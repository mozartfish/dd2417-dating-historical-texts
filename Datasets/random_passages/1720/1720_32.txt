We’ll do’t. _Jailor_. Miss _Polly_ and Miss _Lucy_ intreat a Word with you. _Macheath_. Gentlemen, adieu. [_Exeunt_ Ben Budge _and_ Matt. Enter _Lucy_ and _Polly_. _Macheath_. My dear _Lucy_—My dear _Polly_—Whatsoever hath pass’d between us is now at an end—If you are fond of marrying again, the best Advice I can give you, is to Ship yourselves off for the _West-Indies_, where you’ll have a fair Chance of getting a Husband a-piece, or by good Luck, two or three, as you like
