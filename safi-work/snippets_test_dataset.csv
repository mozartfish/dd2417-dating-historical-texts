an abandoned tin trunk ; there was a straw hat trampled into the now hardened mud , and at the top of West Hill a lot of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough . My movements were languid , my plans of the vaguest . I had an idea of going to Leatherhead , though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of finding my wife . Certainly , unless death had overtaken them suddenly , my cousins and she would have fled thence ; but it seemed to me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled . I knew I wanted to find my wife , that my heart ached for her and the world of men , but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done .	1890
into which the mouth opened , and the heart and its vessels . The pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin . And this was the sum of the Martian organs . Strange as it may seem to a human being , all the complex apparatus of digestion , which makes up the bulk of our bodies , did not exist in the Martians . They were heads—merely heads . Entrails they had none . They did not eat , much less digest . Instead , they took the fresh , living blood of other creatures , and _injected_	1890
the sand-pits . III . ON HORSELL COMMON . I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay . I have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk , embedded in the ground . The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion . No doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire . Henderson and Ogilvy were not there . I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present , and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson ’ s house . There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit , with their feet dangling , and amusing	1890
a dream . I asked myself had these latter things indeed happened ? I could not credit it . I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge . My mind was blank wonder . My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength . I dare say I staggered drunkenly . A head rose over the arch , and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared . Beside him ran a little boy . He passed me , wishing me good night . I was minded to speak to him , but did not . I answered his greeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge . Over the Maybury arch	1890
The Last Man Left Alive ! Hurrah ! The Last Man Left Alive ! ” Troubled as they were with their own affairs , these people , whose name , much as I would like to express my gratitude to them , I may not even give here , nevertheless cumbered themselves with me , sheltered me , and protected me from myself . Apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse . Very gently , when my mind was assured again , did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead .	1890
in the morning , rushing over Winchester eastward , a line of flame high in the atmosphere . Hundreds must have seen it , and taken it for an ordinary falling star . Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds . Denning , our greatest authority on meteorites , stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles . It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him . I was at home at that hour and writing in my study ; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and	1890
o ’ clock with incredible tidings , and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done . People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows , and saw only a rare , flickering , vanishing spark dance up from the direction of Horsell , a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars , and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening . It was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible . There were half a dozen villas burning on the Woking border . There were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages , and the people there	1890
sorts that it is possible to imagine . For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames , they came on to the Essex coast , to Harwich and Walton and Clacton , and afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury , to bring off the people . They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze . Close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—English , Scotch , French , Dutch , and Swedish ; steam launches from the Thames , yachts , electric boats ; and beyond were ships of larger burden , a multitude of filthy colliers , trim merchantmen , cattle ships , passenger boats , petroleum tanks , ocean	1890
periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine . Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish dust . From this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air . As I looked , the handling-machine , with a faint and musical clinking , extended , telescopic fashion , a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection , until its end was hidden behind the mound of	1890
Ogilvy , and the others . But there was little I didn ’ t know . The Martians did not show an inch of themselves . They seemed busy in their pit , and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke . Apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle . “ Fresh attempts have been made to signal , but without success , ” was the stereotyped formula of the papers . A sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole . The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow . I must confess the sight of all this armament , all this preparation ,	1890
my brother , wiping the blood from his split lip . She turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony . The robbers had evidently had enough of it . When my brother looked again they were retreating . “ I ’ ll sit here , ” said my brother , “ if I may ” ; and he got upon the empty front seat . The lady looked over her shoulder . “ Give me the reins , ” she said , and laid the whip along the pony ’ s side . In another moment a bend in the road hid the three	1890
on high and discharged it , gunwise , with a heavy report that made the ground heave . The one towards Staines answered him . There was no flash , no smoke , simply that loaded detonation . I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury . As I did so a second report followed , and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards Hounslow . I expected at least to see smoke or fire , or some such evidence of its work . But all I saw was the deep blue sky above , with one solitary star , and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath . And there had been no crash , no answering explosion . The	1890
good is religion if it collapses under calamity ? Think of what earthquakes and floods , wars and volcanoes , have done before to men ! Did you think God had exempted Weybridge ? He is not an insurance agent. ” For a time he sat in blank silence . “ But how can we escape ? ” he asked , suddenly . “ They are invulnerable , they are pitiless. ” “ Neither the one nor , perhaps , the other , ” I answered . “ And the mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be . One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago. ” “ Killed ! ” he said , staring	1890
swaying its blind head to and fro . Once , even , it touched the heel of my boot . I was on the verge of screaming ; I bit my hand . For a time the tentacle was silent . I could have fancied it had been withdrawn . Presently , with an abrupt click , it gripped something—I thought it had me ! —and seemed to go out of the cellar again . For a minute I was not sure . Apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine . I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position , which had become cramped , and then listened . I whispered passionate prayers for safety . Then I heard the slow , deliberate sound creeping towards me again . Slowly , slowly it drew near , scratching against the walls and tapping the furniture . While	1890
sawing-machine and its engine . Hard by was a temporary hut , deserted . There was not a breath of wind this morning , and everything was strangely still . Even the birds were hushed , and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders . Once or twice we stopped to listen . After a time we drew near the road , and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards Woking . We hailed them , and they halted while we hurried towards them	1890
have become practically mere brains , wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet . And of their appliances , perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent—the _wheel_ is absent ; among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels . One would have at least expected it in locomotion . And in this connection it	1890
persons were returning . The crowd about the pit had increased , and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people , perhaps . There were raised voices , and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit . Strange imaginings passed through my mind . As I drew nearer I heard Stent ’ s voice : “ Keep back ! Keep back ! ” A boy came running towards me . “ It ’ s a-movin ’ , ” he said to me as he passed ; “ a-screwin ’ and a-screwin ’ out . I don ’ t like it . I ’ m a-goin ’ ’ ome , I am. ” I went on to the crowd . There were really , I should think , two or three hundred people elbowing	1890
seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading , and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers . Men came scrambling off buses to secure copies . Certainly this news excited people intensely , whatever their previous apathy . The shutters of a map shop in the Strand were being taken down , my brother said , and a man in his Sunday raiment , lemon-yellow gloves even , was visible inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass . Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square , the paper in	1890
. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into that house—afterwards I found the front door was on the latch—nor how I ransacked every room for food , until just on the verge of despair , in what seemed to me to be a servant ’ s bedroom , I found a rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple . The place had been already searched and emptied . In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked . The latter I could not eat , they were too rotten , but the former not only stayed my hunger , but filled my pockets . I lit no lamps , fearing some Martian might come beating that part of London for food in the	1890
eddy of people drove into its mouth ; weaklings elbowed out of the stream , who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again . A little way down the lane , with two friends bending over him , lay a man with a bare leg , wrapped about with bloody rags . He was a lucky man to have friends . A little old man , with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat , limped out and sat down beside the trap , removed his boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble , and hobbled on again ; and then a little girl of eight or nine , all alone , threw herself under the hedge close by my brother , weeping .	1890

You always want trenches ; you ought to ha ’ been born a rabbit Snippy. ” “ Ain ’ t they got any necks , then ? ” said a third , abruptly—a little , contemplative , dark man , smoking a pipe . I repeated my description . “ Octopuses , ” said he , “ that ’ s what I calls ’ em . Talk about fishers of men—fighters of fish it is this time ! ” “ It ain ’ t no murder killing beasts like that , ” said the first speaker . “ Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’	1890
energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process . Our bodies are half made up of glands and tubes and organs , occupied in turning heterogeneous food into blood . The digestive processes and their reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds . Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers , or sound gastric glands . But the Martians were lifted above all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion . Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with them as provisions from Mars . These creatures , to judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands , were bipeds with	1890
: greyish billowy movements , one above another , and then two luminous disks—like eyes . Then something resembling a little grey snake , about the thickness of a walking stick , coiled up out of the writhing middle , and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another . A sudden chill came over me . There was a loud shriek from a woman behind . I half turned , keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still , from which other tentacles were now projecting , and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit . I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me . I heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides . There was a general movement backwards .	1890
when he suggested a meal , I was nothing loath . He became suddenly very generous , and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars . We lit these , and his optimism glowed . He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion . “ There ’ s some champagne in the cellar , ” he said . “ We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy , ” said I . “ No , ” said he ; “ I am host today . Champagne ! Great God ! We ’ ve a heavy enough task before us ! Let us take a rest and gather strength while we may .	1890
town . At sight of these strange , swift , and terrible creatures the crowd near the water ’ s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck . There was no screaming or shouting , but a silence . Then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet—a splashing from the water . A man , too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder , swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden . A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me . I turned with the rush of the people , but I was not too terrified for thought . The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind . To get under water ! That was it ! “ Get	1890
hill , and by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham . The red weed was tumultuous at that time , and nearly choked the bridge roadway ; but its fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly . At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a man lying . He was as black as a sweep with the black dust , alive , but helplessly and speechlessly drunk . I could get nothing from him but curses and furious lunges at my head . I think I should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face . There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards , and it grew thicker in Fulham . The streets were horribly quiet . I got food—sour , hard ,	1890
with their backs to the group in the lane . Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels , stumbling in the ditches , blundering into one another . The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another , making little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so , sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the villas . “ Push on ! ” was the cry . “ Push on ! They are coming ! ” In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army , gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling , “ Eternity ! Eternity ! ” His voice was hoarse and very loud so	1890
the Martians warred in the same spirit ? The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity . Had our instruments permitted it , we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century . Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd , by-the-bye , that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well . All that time the Martians must have been getting ready . During the opposition of a great light was	1890
the skull of a sheep . But though I gnawed parts of these in my mouth , there was nothing to be got from them . After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney , where I think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason . And in the garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes , sufficient to stay my hunger . From this garden one looked down upon Putney and the river . The aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate : blackened trees , blackened , desolate ruins , and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river , red-tinged with the weed . And	1890
it was . There were no witnesses—all these things I might have concealed . But I set it down , and the reader must form his judgment as he will . And when , by an effort , I had set aside that picture of a prostrate body , I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife . For the former I had no data ; I could imagine a hundred things , and so , unhappily , I could for the latter . And suddenly that night became terrible . I found myself sitting up in bed , staring at the dark . I found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and painlessly struck her out of being . Since the night of	1890
assured again , did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead . Two days after I was imprisoned it had been destroyed , with every soul in it , by a Martian . He had swept it out of existence , as it seemed , without any provocation , as a boy might crush an ant hill , in the mere wantonness of power . I was a lonely man , and they were very kind to me . I was a lonely man and a sad one , and they bore with me . I remained with them four days after my recovery . All that time I felt a vague , a growing craving to look	1890
) I saw along the western horizon a blood-red glow , which as I drew nearer , crept slowly up the sky . The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke . Ripley Street was deserted , and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life ; but I narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford , where a knot of people stood with their backs to me . They said nothing to me as I passed . I do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill , nor do I	1890
out of life . I came into the road between the crossroads and Horsell , and ran along this to the crossroads . At last I could go no further ; I was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight , and I staggered and fell by the wayside . That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks . I fell and lay still . I must have remained there some time . I sat up , strangely perplexed . For a moment , perhaps , I could not clearly understand how I came there . My terror had fallen from me like a garment . My hat had gone , and my collar had burst away from its fastener . A few minutes before , there had only been three real things before me—the immensity of	1890
and I had immediately to turn my attention to the horse . When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke . I slashed the horse with the whip , and gave him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult . I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send . X . IN THE STORM . Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill . The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford , and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses . The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began , leaving	1890
was just setting , and the Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine , a sky of gold , barred with long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud . There was talk of a floating body . One of the men there , a reservist he said he was , told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west . In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and staring placards . “ Dreadful catastrophe ! ” they bawled one to the other down Wellington Street . “ Fighting at Weybridge !	1890
and I looked again out of the open window . In one night the valley had become a valley of ashes . The fires had dwindled now . Where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke ; but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn . Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white railway signal here , the end of a greenhouse there , white and fresh amid the wreckage . Never before in the history of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal . And shining with the growing light of the east , three of the metallic	1890
My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen and the scullery . But the pantry was empty ; every scrap of food had gone . Apparently , the Martian had taken it all on the previous day . At that discovery I despaired for the first time . I took no food , or no drink either , on the eleventh or the twelfth day . At first my mouth and throat were parched , and my strength ebbed sensibly . I sat about in the darkness of the scullery , in a state of despondent wretchedness . My mind ran on eating . I thought I had become deaf , for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely . I did not feel strong enough	1890
ruins . My chance of escape had come . I began to tremble . I hesitated for some time , and then , in a gust of desperate resolution , and with a heart that throbbed violently , I scrambled to the top of the mound in which I had been buried so long . I looked about again . To the northward , too , no Martian was visible . When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses , interspersed with abundant shady trees . Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork , clay , and gravel , over which	1890
for ten nights , a flame each night . Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain . It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians inconvenience . Dense clouds of smoke or dust , visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey , fluctuating patches , spread through the clearness of the planet ’ s atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features . Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last , and popular notes appeared here , there , and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars . The seriocomic periodical _Punch_ , I remember , made a happy use of it in the political cartoon . And , all unsuspected , those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward , rushing now	1890
they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate , that periodical extinction was unknown to them . They had little or no sense of fatigue , it would seem . On earth they could never have moved without effort , yet even to the last they kept in action . In twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work , as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants . In the next place , wonderful as it seems in a sexual world , the Martians were absolutely without sex , and therefore without any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men . A young Martian , there can now be no dispute , was really born upon earth during	1890
at last the roads , my brother said , were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day . My brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most . None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man , who assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night . “ I come from Byfleet , ” he said ; “ a man on a bicycle came through the place in the early morning , and ran from door to door warning us to come away . Then came soldiers . We went out to look , and there were clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke , and not a soul coming that way . Then we	1890
upon a cloud , for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height . At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat , and began running ; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian , and I turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road . He looked back , saw what I was doing , and turned to join me . The two halted , the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury , the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star , away towards Staines . The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased ; they took	1890
suffocating drift . We went through Bushey Park , with its deer going to and fro under the chestnuts , and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards Hampton , and so we came to Twickenham . These were the first people we saw . Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire . Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke , and there were more people about here , though none could give us news . For the most part they were like ourselves , taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters . I have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants , too frightened even for flight . Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road . I remember	1890
COMING OF THE MARTIANS I . THE EVE OF THE WAR . No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man ’ s and yet as mortal as his own ; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied , perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water . With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs , serene in their assurance of their empire over matter . It is possible that the infusoria	1890
t have any weak or silly . Life is real again , and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die . They ought to die . They ought to be willing to die . It ’ s a sort of disloyalty , after all , to live and taint the race . And they can ’ t be happy . Moreover , dying ’ s none so dreadful ; it ’ s the funking makes it bad . And in all those places we shall gather . Our district will be London . And we may even be able to keep a watch , and run about in the open when the Martians	1890
in the shed , but he came hurrying after me . That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did . For it was manifest the Martians were about us . No sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or another , far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge . Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the field , and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them . In three strides he was among them , and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions . He	1890
, naked , save for my water-soaked trousers and socks , scalded , and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke . His face was a fair weakness , his chin retreated , and his hair lay in crisp , almost flaxen curls on his low forehead ; his eyes were rather large , pale blue , and blankly staring . He spoke abruptly , looking vacantly away from me . “ What does it mean ? ” he said . “ What do these things mean ? ” I stared at him and made no answer . He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone	1890
the gangway , found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his charges . There was food aboard , albeit at exorbitant prices , and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward . There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard , some of whom had expended their last money in securing a passage , but the captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon , picking up passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded . He would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south . As if in answer , the ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags . A jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels . Some of the passengers were of	1890
rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water . Others did the same . A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I rushed past . The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery , and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep . Then , as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away , I flung myself forward under the surface . The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears . People were landing hastily on both sides of the river . But the Martian machine took no more	1890
“ Stop here , ” said I ; “ you are safe here ” ; and I started off at once for the Spotted Dog , for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart . I ran , for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving . I found him in his bar , quite unaware of what was going on behind his house . A man stood with his back to me , talking to him . “ I must have a pound , ” said the landlord , “ and I ’ ve no one to drive it. ” “ I ’ ll give you two , ” said I , over the stranger ’ s shoulder . “ What for ? ” “ And I ’ ll bring it back by midnight , ”	1890
I felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears . The torment was over . Even that day the healing would begin . The survivors of the people scattered over the country—leaderless , lawless , foodless , like sheep without a shepherd—the thousands who had fled by sea , would begin to return ; the pulse of life , growing stronger and stronger , would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares . Whatever destruction was done , the hand of the destroyer was stayed . All the gaunt wrecks , the blackened skeletons of	1890
“ Fly ! ” “ Yes , ” he said , “ fly. ” I went on into a little bower , and sat down . “ It is all over with humanity , ” I said . “ If they can do that they will simply go round the world. ” He nodded . “ They will . But—— It will relieve things over here a bit . And besides—— ” He looked at me . “ Aren ’ t you satisfied it _is_ up with humanity ? I am . We ’ re down ; we ’ re beat. ” I stared . Strange as it may seem , I had not arrived at this fact—a	1890
my brother ’ s attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south . He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze . The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping , and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy , when a Martian appeared , small and faint in the remote distance , advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness . At that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay , and the paddles seemed infected with his terror . Every	1890

powder in the streets and upon dead bodies . I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham Road . They had been dead many days , so that I hurried quickly past them . The black powder covered them over , and softened their outlines . One or two had been disturbed by dogs . Where there was no black powder , it was curiously like a Sunday in the City , with the closed shops , the houses locked up and the blinds drawn , the desertion , and the stillness . In some places plunderers had been at work , but rarely at other than the provision	1890
in the houses near , and leaving us astonished . “ Here they are ! ” shouted a man in a blue jersey . “ Yonder ! D ’ yer see them ? Yonder ! ” Quickly , one after the other , one , two , three , four of the armoured Martians appeared , far away over the little trees , across the flat meadows that stretched towards Chertsey , and striding hurriedly towards the river . Little cowled figures they seemed at first , going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds . Then , advancing obliquely towards us , came a fifth . Their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns , growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer . One on the extreme left , the remotest that is , flourished a huge case high	1890
least was disposed of—perhaps more . The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger , and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs . And so , with reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with the difficulty , this quasi-proclamation closed . This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still wet , and there had been no time to add a word of comment . It was curious , my brother said , to see how ruthlessly the	1890
What has happened ? ” said the curate , standing up beside me . “ Heaven knows ! ” said I . A bat flickered by and vanished . A distant tumult of shouting began and ceased . I looked again at the Martian , and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank , with a swift , rolling motion . Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him ; but the evening calm was unbroken . The figure of the Martian grew smaller as he receded , and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up . By a common impulse we clambered higher . Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance	1890
, quietly . “ You must keep your head . There is still hope. ” “ Hope ! ” “ Yes . Plentiful hope—for all this destruction ! ” I began to explain my view of our position . He listened at first , but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare , and his regard wandered from me . “ This must be the beginning of the end , ” he said , interrupting me . “ The end ! The great and terrible day of the Lord ! When men shall call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them—hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne ! ” I began to understand the	1890
there in the rain and darkness watching , by the intermittent light , these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops . A thin hail was now beginning , and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again . Now and then came a gap in the lightning , and the night swallowed them up . I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below . It was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position , or think at all of my	1890
. I had the sunset in my eyes . I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men , but in all essentials a man . I know I did . But , looking , I presently saw something stirring within the shadow : greyish billowy movements , one above another , and then two luminous disks—like eyes . Then something resembling a little grey snake , about the thickness of a walking stick , coiled up out of the writhing middle , and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another . A sudden chill came over me . There was a loud shriek from a woman behind . I half turned , keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still , from	1890
London side of Woking station was still undergoing repair , so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury , past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars , and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm . Here , moved by curiosity , I turned aside to find , among a tangle of red fronds , the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed . For a time I stood regarding these vestiges . . . . Then I returned through the pine wood , neck-high with red weed here and there , to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial , and so came home	1890
absolutely insoluble , and it is a strange thing , seeing the instant effect of the gas , that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained . The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do . It hung together in banks , flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the wind , and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air , and sank to the earth in the form of dust . Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in	1890
peeping out furtively across the common . The Cardigan men had tried a rush , in skirmishing order , at the pit , simply to be swept out of existence . Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives , with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being . A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case , about which green flashes scintillated , and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray . In a few minutes there	1890
had swallowed him up . By a common impulse we clambered higher . Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance , as though a conical hill had suddenly come into being there , hiding our view of the farther country ; and then , remoter across the river , over Walton , we saw another such summit . These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared . Moved by a sudden thought , I looked northward , and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen . Everything had suddenly become very still . Far away	1890
It was dark , and suddenly void of men . Overhead the stars were mustering , and in the west the sky was still a pale , bright , almost greenish blue . The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow . The Martians and their appliances were altogether invisible , save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled . Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still , and the houses towards Woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air .	1890
up against the drenching hail . So far as I could see by the flashes , the houses about me were mostly uninjured . By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the road . Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of feet , but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them . I let myself in with my latchkey , closed , locked and bolted the door , staggered to the foot of the staircase , and sat down . My imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters , and of the dead body smashed	1890
. The fronds became bleached , and then shrivelled and brittle . They broke off at the least touch , and the waters that had stimulated their early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea . My first act on coming to this water was , of course , to slake my thirst . I drank a great deal of it and , moved by an impulse , gnawed some fronds of red weed ; but they were watery , and had a sickly , metallic taste . I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely , although the red weed impeded my feet a little ; but the flood evidently got deeper towards the river , and I turned back to Mortlake . I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its villas and	1890
through a veil of smoke , receding interminably , as it seemed to me , across a vast space of river and meadow . And then , very slowly , I realised that by a miracle I had escaped . XIII . HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE . After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons , the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common ; and in their haste , and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion , they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself . Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith , there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns , and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach ; as	1890
that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the hood . At that my heart gave a bound , and I began running along the road . I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund ’ s Terrace ( I waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks towards the Albert Road ) , and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the sun . Great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill , making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and largest place the Martians had made—and from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky . Against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared	1890
on about Weybridge ” was the extent of their information . The train service was now very much disorganised . Quite a number of people who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western network were standing about the station . One grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother . “ It wants showing up , ” he said . One or two trains came in from Richmond , Putney , and Kingston , containing people who had gone out for a day ’ s boating and found the locks closed and a feeling	1890
sea , Mrs. Elphinstone , in spite of the assurances of her sister-in-law , gave way to panic . She had never been out of England before , she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country , and so forth . She seemed , poor woman , to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar . She had been growing increasingly hysterical , fearful , and depressed during the two days ’ journeyings . Her great idea was to return to Stanmore . Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore . They would find George at Stanmore .... It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach	1890
round swiftly and steadily , this flaming death , this invisible , inevitable sword of heat . I perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched , and was too astounded and stupefied to stir . I heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled . Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians , and all along a curving line beyond the sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled . Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common	1890
no black powder , it was curiously like a Sunday in the City , with the closed shops , the houses locked up and the blinds drawn , the desertion , and the stillness . In some places plunderers had been at work , but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops . A jeweller ’ s window had been broken open in one place , but apparently the thief had been disturbed , and a number of gold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement . I did not trouble to touch them . Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep ; the hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown	1890
against his furnace—my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road , dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles , and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop . The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window , but he got up and off , notwithstanding , with no further injury than a cut wrist . The steep foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses , and my brother struck into Belsize Road . So he got out of the fury of the panic , and , skirting the Edgware Road , reached Edgware about seven , fasting and wearied , but	1890
their pit , and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke . Apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle . “ Fresh attempts have been made to signal , but without success , ” was the stereotyped formula of the papers . A sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole . The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow . I must confess the sight of all this armament ,	1890
were all alight . I stopped at the group of people . “ What news from the common ? ” said I . There were two men and a woman at the gate . “ Eh ? ” said one of the men , turning . “ What news from the common ? ” I said . “ Ain ’ t yer just _been_ there ? ” asked the men . “ People seem fair silly about the common , ” said the woman over the gate . “ What ’ s it all abart ? ” “ Haven ’	1890
route of the Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions . A nocturnal newspaper reporter , mistaking my brother for the traffic manager , to whom he bears a slight resemblance , waylaid and tried to interview him . Few people , excepting the railway officials , connected the breakdown with the Martians . I have read , in another account of these events , that on Sunday morning “ all London was electrified by the news from Woking. ” As a matter of fact , there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase . Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday morning . Those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed . The majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers . The habit	1890
was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians , and all along a curving line beyond the sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled . Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common . Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased , and the black , dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit . All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless , dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light . Had that death swept through a full circle , it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise . But it passed and spared me , and left the night about me suddenly	1890
ever ! ” he shouted . His eyes flamed , and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of Weybridge . By this time I was beginning to take his measure . The tremendous tragedy in which he had been involved—it was evident he was a fugitive from Weybridge—had driven him to the very verge of his reason . “ Are we far from Sunbury ? ” I said , in a matter-of-fact tone . “ What are we to do ? ” he asked . “ Are these creatures everywhere ? Has the earth been given over to them ? ” “ Are we far from Sunbury ? ” “ Only this morning I officiated at early celebration—— ” “ Things have changed , ” I said , quietly . “ You must	1890
brain , sending enormous nerves to the eyes , ear , and tactile tentacles . Besides this were the bulky lungs , into which the mouth opened , and the heart and its vessels . The pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin . And this was the sum of the Martian organs . Strange as it may seem to a human being , all the complex apparatus of digestion , which makes up the bulk of our bodies , did not exist in the Martians . They were heads—merely heads . Entrails they had none . They did not eat , much less digest . Instead , they took the fresh , living blood of other creatures , and _injected_ it into their own veins . I	1890
every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond , masked an expectant black muzzle . And through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles altogether—that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common , through charred and ruined villages among the green trees , through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys , crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach . But the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity , and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder , save at the price of his life .	1890
then , remoter across the river , over Walton , we saw another such summit . These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared . Moved by a sudden thought , I looked northward , and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen . Everything had suddenly become very still . Far away to the southeast , marking the quiet , we heard the Martians hooting to one another , and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns . But the earthly artillery made no reply . Now at the time we could not understand these things ,	1890
by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment , and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window . And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country , and especially wherever there was a stream of water . The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ , a single round drum at the back of the head-body , and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours except that , according to Philips , blue and violet were as black to them . It is commonly supposed that they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations ; this is asserted , for instance , in the	1890
effect , and the generator of the Heat-Rays remains a puzzle . The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further investigations upon the latter . Spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green , and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood . But such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader , to whom this story is	1890
” Excited men came into the station about nine o ’ clock with incredible tidings , and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done . People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows , and saw only a rare , flickering , vanishing spark dance up from the direction of Horsell , a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars , and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening . It was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible . There were half a dozen villas burning	1890
blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the eye could reach . And through this two Martians slowly waded , and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that . They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night , either because they had but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they had aroused . In the latter aim they certainly succeeded . Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to their movements . After that no body of men would stand against them , so hopeless was the enterprise . Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and destroyers	1890
still . I heard a sound like the flutter of a bird ’ s wings , and a hoarse croaking , but that was all . For a long while I lay close to the peephole , but not daring to move aside the red plants that obscured it . Once or twice I heard a faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me , and there were more birdlike sounds , but that was all . At length , encouraged by the silence , I looked out . Except in the corner , where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed , there was not a living thing in the pit . I stared about me , scarcely believing my eyes . All the machinery	1890
and of the manner of his death . On the thirteenth day I drank some more water , and dozed and thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape . Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms , of the death of the curate , or of sumptuous dinners ; but , asleep or awake , I felt a keen pain that urged me to drink again and again . The light that came into the scullery was no longer grey , but red . To my disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood . On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen , and I was surprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall , turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity . It was early on the fifteenth	1890
of a tranquil evening sky . For a minute or so I remained watching the curate , and then I advanced , crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor . I touched the curate ’ s leg , and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact . I gripped his arm , fearing he might cry out , and for a long time we crouched motionless . Then I turned to see how much of our rampart remained . The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris , and by raising myself cautiously across a	1890
with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use . He was driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge ; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six respectable-looking people in it , and some boxes and bundles . The faces of these people were haggard , and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people on the omnibuses . People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs . They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take , and finally turned eastward along the Strand . Some way behind these came a man in workday clothes , riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel . He was dirty and white in the face	1890
the night my brain , reinforced , I suppose , by the food I had eaten , grew clear again , and I thought . Three things struggled for possession of my mind : the killing of the curate , the whereabouts of the Martians , and the possible fate of my wife . The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall ; I saw it simply as a thing done , a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse . I saw myself then as I see myself now , driven step by step towards that hasty blow , the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that . I felt no condemnation ; yet the memory , static , unprogressive , haunted me . In the	1890
and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further investigations upon the latter . Spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green , and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood . But such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader , to whom this story is addressed . None of the brown scum that drifted down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was	1890
, others were shunting on the sidings , passengers were alighting and waiting , and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way . A boy from the town , trenching on Smith ’ s monopoly , was selling papers with the afternoon ’ s news . The ringing impact of trucks , the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction , mingled with their shouts of “ Men from Mars ! ” Excited men came into the station about nine o ’ clock with incredible tidings , and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done . People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows , and saw only a rare , flickering , vanishing spark dance up from the direction of Horsell , a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars , and thought	1890
saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall , but traces of men there were none . The day seemed , by contrast with my recent confinement , dazzlingly bright , the sky a glowing blue . A gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying . And oh ! the sweetness of the air ! VI . THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS . For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety . Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security . I had not realised what had been happening to the world	1890
each side of the road were empty and still , and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses . At the top , near the park gate , I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned , and the skeleton of a horse picked clean . I puzzled over this for a time , and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine . The voice grew stronger and stronger , though I could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park , save a haze of smoke to the northwest . “ Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , ” cried the	1890
something—something struggling violently—was lifted high against the sky , a black , vague enigma against the starlight ; and as this black object came down again , I saw by the green brightness that it was a man . For an instant he was clearly visible . He was a stout , ruddy , middle-aged man , well dressed ; three days before , he must have been walking the world , a man of considerable consequence . I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain . He vanished behind the mound , and for a moment there was silence . And then began a	1890
panic in the air . A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother , full of strange tidings . “ There ’ s hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and things , with boxes of valuables and all that , ” he said . “ They come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton , and they say there ’ s been guns heard at Chertsey , heavy firing , and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming . We heard guns firing at Hampton Court station , but we thought it was thunder . What the dickens does it all mean ? The	1890
one hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things . His paroxysm of rage over , he went on his way without once looking back . As my brother ’ s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on their left , carrying a child and with two other children ; and then passed a man in dirty black , with a thick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other . Then round the corner of the lane , from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high road , came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven	1890
upon a strange sight—a bus overturned , and the skeleton of a horse picked clean . I puzzled over this for a time , and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine . The voice grew stronger and stronger , though I could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park , save a haze of smoke to the northwest . “ Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , ” cried the voice , coming , as it seemed to me , from the district about Regent ’ s Park . The desolating cry worked upon my mind . The mood that had sustained me passed . The wailing took possession of me . I	1890
drawing towards its close , so likewise must the Day of Man 's Existence decline into dust and darkness ; and with all its sick toilings , and joyful and mournful noises , sink in the still Eternity . `` To our Friend the hours seemed moments ; holy was he and happy : the words from those sweetest lips came over him like dew on thirsty grass ; all better feelings in his soul seemed to whisper , It is good for us to be here .

What , being hid from us , as in the signless Inane ? `` System of Nature ! To the wisest man , wide as is his vision , Nature remains of quite _infinite_ depth , of quite infinite expansion ; and all Experience thereof limits itself to some few computed centuries and measured square-miles . The course of Nature 's phases , on this our little fraction of a Planet , is partially known to us : but who knows what deeper courses these depend on ; what infinitely larger Cycle ( of causes ) our little Epicycle revolves on ?

Then , in that strange Dream , how we clutch at shadows as if they were substances ; and sleep deepest while fancying ourselves most awake !

For most part , too , we must admit that the Learning , heterogeneous as it is , and tumbled down quite pell-mell , is true concentrated and purified Learning , the drossy parts smelted out and thrown aside . Philosophical reflections intervene , and sometimes touching pictures of	1830

However , that is not our chief grievance ; the Professor continues : -- `` Why multiply instances ?

However , such a conscious , recognized groundplan , the truest I had , _was_ beginning to be there , and by additional experiments might be corrected and indefinitely extended . '' Thus from poverty does the strong educe nobler wealth ; thus in the destitution of the wild desert does our young Ishmael acquire for himself the highest of all possessions , that of Self-help . Nevertheless a desert this was , waste , and howling with savage monsters . Teufelsdrockh gives us long details of his `` fever-paroxysms of Doubt ; '' his Inquiries	1830
, and miscellaneous Functionaries , are advancing gallantly to the Anointed Presence ; and I strive , in my remote privacy , to form a clear picture of that solemnity , -- on a sudden , as by some enchanter 's wand , the -- shall I speak it ? -- the Clothes fly off the whole dramatic corps ; and Dukes , Grandees , Bishops , Generals , Anointed Presence itself , every mother 's son of them , stand straddling there , not a shirt on them ; and I know not whether to laugh or weep . This physical or psychical infirmity , in which perhaps I am not singular , I have , after hesitation ,	1830
devisable Box , Edifice , or Steam-mechanism . It were a mighty convenience ; and beyond all feats of manufacture witnessed hitherto . '' Is Teufelsdrockh acquainted with the British constitution , even slightly ? -- He says , under another figure : `` But after all , were the problem , as indeed it now everywhere is , To rebuild your old House from the top downwards ( since you must live in it the while ) , what better , what other , than the Representative Machine will serve your turn ? Meanwhile , however , mock me not with the name of Free , 'when you have but knit up my chains into ornamental festoons . ' '' -- Or what will any member of	1830
as the smallest of fractions even to Shall . Hereby was laid for me the basis of worldly Discretion , nay of Morality itself . Let me not quarrel with my upbringing . It was rigorous , too frugal , compressively secluded , every way unscientific : yet in that very strictness and domestic solitude might there not lie the root of deeper earnestness , of the stem from which all noble fruit must grow ? Above all , how unskilful soever , it was loving , it was well-meant , honest ; whereby every deficiency was helped . My kind Mother , for as such I must ever love the good Gretchen , did me one altogether invaluable service : she taught me , less indeed by word than by act and daily reverent look and habitude , her own simple version of	1830
our united Mankind , in a wide Universe of Nescience , has acquired , why is not this , with all diligence , imparted to all ? '' Quite in an opposite strain is the following : `` The old Spartans had a wiser method ; and went out and hunted down their Helots , and speared and spitted them , when they grew too numerous . With our improved fashions of hunting , Herr Hofrath , now after the invention of fire-arms , and standing armies , how much easier were such a hunt ! Perhaps in the most thickly peopled country , some three days annually might suffice to shoot all the able-bodied Paupers that had accumulated within the year . Let Governments think of this . The expense were trifling : nay the very	1830
how should she ever think of him ; O Heaven ! how should they so much as once meet together ? And now that Rose-goddess sits in the same circle with him ; the light of _her_ eyes has smiled on him ; if he speak , she will hear it ! Nay , who knows , since the heavenly Sun looks into lowest valleys , but Blumine herself might have aforetime noted the so unnotable ; perhaps , from his very gainsayers , as he had from hers , gathered wonder , gathered favor for him ? Was the attraction , the agitation mutual , then ; pole and pole trembling towards contact , when once	1830
city of stones , yearly crumbling , yearly needing repair ; more like a tilled field , but then a spiritual field : like a spiritual tree , let me rather say , it stands from year to year , and from age to age ( we have Books that already number some hundred and fifty human ages ) ; and yearly comes its new produce of leaves ( Commentaries , Deductions , Philosophical , Political Systems ; or were it only Sermons , Pamphlets , Journalistic Essays ) , every one of which is talismanic and thaumaturgic , for it can persuade men . O thou who art able	1830
this Love-mania , and with what royal splendor it waxes , and rises . Let no one ask us to unfold the glories of its dominant state ; much less the horrors of its almost instantaneous dissolution . How from such inorganic masses , henceforth madder than ever , as lie in these Bags , can even fragments of a living delineation be organized ? Besides , of what profit were it ? We view , with a lively pleasure , the gay silk Montgolfier start from the ground , and shoot upwards , cleaving the liquid deeps , till it dwindle to	1830
this ; or what make ye of your _Nothing can act but where it is_ ? Red has no physical hold of Blue , no _clutch_ of him , is nowise in _contact_ with him : neither are those ministering Sheriffs and Lord-Lieutenants and Hangmen and Tipstaves so related to commanding Red , that he can tug them hither and thither ; but each stands distinct within his own skin . Nevertheless , as it is spoken , so is it done : the articulated Word sets all hands in Action ; and Rope and Improved-drop perform their work . `` Thinking reader , the reason seems to me twofold : First , that _Man is a Spirit_ , and bound by invisible bonds to _All Men_ ; secondly , that _he wears Clothes_ , which are	1830
Clothes , which a German Professor , of unequalled learning and acumen , writes his enormous Volume to demonstrate , has sprung up in the intellect of the Dandy without effort , like an instinct of genius ; he is inspired with Cloth , a Poet of Cloth . What Teufelsdrockh would call a `` Divine Idea of Cloth '' is born with him ; and this , like other such Ideas , will express itself outwardly , or wring his heart asunder with unutterable throes . But , like a generous , creative enthusiast , he fearlessly makes his Idea	1830
for copper alms and the love of God . These break in pieces the ancient idols ; and , though themselves too often reprobate , as idol-breakers are wont to be , mark out the sites of new Churches , where the true God-ordained , that are to follow , may find audience , and minister . Said I not , Before the old skin was shed , the new had formed itself beneath it ? '' Perhaps also in the following ; wherewith we now hasten to knit up this ravelled sleeve : -- `` But there is no Religion ? '' reiterates the Professor . `` Fool ! I tell thee , there is . Hast thou well considered all that lies in this immeasurable froth-ocean we name LITERATURE ? Fragments of	1830
among the more enlightened classes , was the admiration of this new Professorship : how an enlightened Government had seen into the Want of the Age ( _Zeitbedurfniss_ ) ; how at length , instead of Denial and Destruction , we were to have a science of Affirmation and Reconstruction ; and Germany and Weissnichtwo were where they should be , in the vanguard of the world . Considerable also was the wonder at the new Professor , dropt opportunely enough into the nascent University ; so able to lecture , should occasion call ; so ready to hold his peace for indefinite periods , should an enlightened Government consider that occasion did not call . But such admiration and such wonder , being followed by no act to keep them living , could last only	1830
in leather jerkins , leather skull-caps , and long ox-goads ; shouting in half-articulate speech , amid the inarticulate barking and bellowing . Apart stood Potters from far Saxony , with their crockery in fair rows ; Nurnberg Pedlers , in booths that to me seemed richer than Ormuz bazaars ; Showmen from the Lago Maggiore ; detachments of the _Wiener Schub_ ( Offscourings of Vienna ) vociferously superintending games of chance . Ballad-singers brayed , Auctioneers grew hoarse ; cheap New Wine ( _heuriger_ ) flowed like water , still worse confounding the confusion ; and high over all , vaulted , in ground-and-lofty tumbling , a particolored Merry-Andrew , like the genius of the place and of Life itself . `` Thus encircled by the mystery of Existence ; under the deep heavenly	1830
remains doubtful whether he is laughing in his sleeve at these Autobiographical times of ours , or writing from the abundance of his own fond ineptitude . For he continues : `` If among the ever-streaming currents of Sights , Hearings , Feelings for Pain or Pleasure , whereby , as in a Magic Hall , young Gneschen went about environed , I might venture to select and specify , perhaps these following were also of the number : `` Doubtless , as childish sports call forth Intellect , Activity , so the young creature 's Imagination was stirred up , and a Historical tendency given him by the narrative habits of Father Andreas ; who , with his battle-reminiscences , and gray austere yet hearty patriarchal aspect ,	1830
of a Product , produce it , in God 's name ! 'T is the utmost thou hast in thee : out with it , then . Up , up ! Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy whole might . Work while it is called To-day ; for the Night cometh , wherein no man can work . '' CHAPTER X . PAUSE . Thus have we , as closely and perhaps satisfactorily as , in such circumstances , might be , followed Teufelsdrockh , through the various successive states and stages of Growth , Entanglement , Unbelief , and almost Reprobation , into a	1830
, and half fancied that their stillness was but the rest of infinite motion , the _sleep_ of a spinning-top ? Thy little figure , there as , in loose ill-brushed threadbare habiliments , thou sattest , amid litter and lumber , whole days , to `` think and smoke tobacco , '' held in it a mighty heart . The secrets of man 's Life were laid open to thee ; thou sawest into the mystery of the Universe , farther than another ; thou hadst _in petto_ thy remarkable Volume on Clothes . Nay , was there not in that clear logically founded Transcendentalism of thine	1830
those wool-rags , a Garment of Flesh ( or of Senses ) , contextured in the Loom of Heaven ; whereby he is revealed to his like , and dwells with them in UNION and DIVISION ; and sees and fashions for himself a Universe , with azure Starry Spaces , and long Thousands of Years . Deep-hidden is he under that strange Garment ; amid Sounds and Colors and Forms , as it were , swathed in , and inextricably over-shrouded : yet it is sky-woven , and worthy of a God . Stands he not thereby in the centre of Immensities , in the conflux of Eternities ? He feels ; power has been	1830
kept his mind much to himself ; above all , that seldom or never cried . He already felt that time was precious ; that he had other work cut out for him than whimpering . '' Such , after utmost painful search and collation among these miscellaneous Paper-masses , is all the notice we can gather of Herr Teufelsdrockh 's genealogy . More imperfect , more enigmatic it can seem to few readers than to us . The Professor , in whom truly we more and more discern a certain satirical turn , and deep under-currents of roguish whim , for the present stands pledged in honor , so we will not doubt him : but seems it not conceivable that , by the `` good Gretchen Futteral , '' or some other perhaps	1830
circle the appearance of this singular Work on Clothes must have occasioned little less surprise than it has to the rest of the world . For ourselves , at least , few things have been more unexpected . Professor Teufelsdrockh , at the period of our acquaintance with him , seemed to lead a quite still and self-contained life : a man devoted to the higher Philosophies , indeed ; yet more likely , if he published at all , to publish a refutation of Hegel and Bardili , both of whom , strangely enough , he included under a common ban ; than to descend , as he has	1830
light is darker than darkness ; eat you your wages , and sleep ! `` Thus , too , '' continues he , `` does an observant eye discern everywhere that saddest spectacle : The Poor perishing , like neglected , foundered Draught-Cattle , of Hunger and Overwork ; the Rich , still more wretchedly , of Idleness , Satiety , and Overgrowth . The Highest in rank , at length , without honor from the Lowest ; scarcely , with a little mouth-honor , as from tavern-waiters who expect to put it in the bill . Once-sacred Symbols fluttering as empty Pageants , whereof men grudge even the expense ; a	1830
its horrors , were properly the only grandeur there is in History . Let some living Angelo or Rosa , with seeing eye and understanding heart , picture George Fox on that morning , when he spreads out his cutting-board for the last time , and cuts cowhides by unwonted patterns , and stitches them together into one continuous all-including Case , the farewell service of his awl ! Stitch away , thou noble Fox : every prick of that little instrument is pricking into the heart of Slavery , and World-worship , and the Mammon-god . Thy elbows jerk , as in strong swimmer-strokes , and every stroke is bearing thee	1830
; we , safe in the stronghold of Historical Fidelity , are careless . The main point , doubtless , for us all , is his love of Teufelsdrockh , which indeed was also by far the most decisive feature of Heuschrecke himself . We are enabled to assert that he hung on the Professor with the fondness of a Boswell for his Johnson . And perhaps with the like return ; for Teufelsdrockh treated his gaunt admirer with little outward regard , as some half-rational or altogether irrational friend , and at best loved him out of gratitude and by habit . On the other	1830
it ! Dost thou , does man , so much as well know the Alphabet thereof ? With its Words , Sentences , and grand descriptive Pages , poetical and philosophical , spread out through Solar Systems , and Thousands of Years , we shall not try thee . It is a Volume written in celestial hieroglyphs , in the true Sacred-writing ; of which even Prophets are happy that they can read here a line and there a line . As for your Institutes , and Academies of Science , they strive bravely ; and , from amid the thick-crowded , inextricably intertwisted hieroglyphic writing , pick out , by dexterous combination , some Letters in the vulgar Character , and therefrom put together	1830
and tangible on their little parlor-table . Towards this the astonished couple , now with lit candle , hastily turned their attention . Lifting the green veil , to see what invaluable it hid , they descried there , amid down and rich white wrappages , no Pitt Diamond or Hapsburg Regalia , but , in the softest sleep , a little red-colored Infant ! Beside it , lay a roll of gold Friedrichs , the exact amount of which was never publicly known ; also a _Taufschein_ ( baptismal certificate ) , wherein unfortunately nothing but the Name was decipherable , other document or indication none whatever . `` To wonder and conjecture was unavailing , then and always thenceforth . Nowhere in Entepfuhl , on the morrow or next day , did tidings transpire of any such figure as the Stranger ; nor	1830
: it skills not ; the undiscerning public , occupied with grosser wants , passes by regardless on the other side . The age of Curiosity , like that of Chivalry , is indeed , properly speaking , gone . Yet perhaps only gone to sleep : for here arises the Clothes-Philosophy to resuscitate , strangely enough , both the one and the other ! Should sound views of this Science come to prevail , the essential nature of the British Dandy , and the mystic significance that lies in him , can not always remain hidden under laughable and lamentable hallucination . The following long Extract from Professor Teufelsdrockh may set the matter , if not in its true light , yet in the way towards such . It is to be regretted , however , that here , as so often elsewhere ,	1830
, we have a blooming , fertile , heaven-encompassed World . `` I too could now say to myself : Be no longer a Chaos , but a World , or even Worldkin . Produce ! Produce ! Were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction of a Product , produce it , in God 's name ! 'T is the utmost thou hast in thee : out with it , then . Up , up ! Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy whole might . Work while it is called To-day ; for the Night cometh , wherein no man can work . '' CHAPTER X . PAUSE . Thus have we , as closely	1830
one of three things which he can next do : Establish himself in Bedlam ; begin writing Satanic Poetry ; or blow out his brains . In the progress towards any of which consummations , do not such readers anticipate extravagance enough ; breast-beating , brow-beating ( against walls ) , lion-bellowings of blasphemy and the like , stampings , smitings , breakages of furniture , if not arson itself ? Nowise so does Teufelsdrockh deport him . He quietly lifts his _Pilgerstab_ ( Pilgrim-staff ) , `` old business being soon wound up ; '' and begins a perambulation and circumambulation of the terraqueous	1830
window , nothing save that old calmness and fixedness was visible . These were the Professor 's talking seasons : most commonly he spoke in mere monosyllables , or sat altogether silent and smoked ; while the visitor had liberty either to say what he listed , receiving for answer an occasional grunt ; or to look round for a space , and then take himself away . It was a strange apartment ; full of books and tattered papers , and miscellaneous shreds of all conceivable substances , `` united in a common element of dust . '' Books lay on tables , and below tables ; here fluttered a sheet of manuscript , there a torn handkerchief , or nightcap hastily thrown aside ; ink-bottles alternated with bread-crusts , coffee-pots , tobacco-boxes , Periodical Literature	1830
if , '' says he , `` the higher did not presuppose the lower ; as if he who can fly into heaven , could not also walk post if he resolved on it ! But the world is an old woman , and mistakes any gilt farthing for a gold coin ; whereby being often cheated , she will thenceforth trust nothing but the common copper . '' How our winged sky-messenger , unaccepted as a terrestrial runner , contrived , in the mean while , to keep himself from flying skyward without return , is not too clear from these Documents . Good old Gretchen seems to have vanished from the scene , perhaps from the Earth ; other Horn of	1830
heart and life are penetrated and informed with the spirit of politeness ; a noble natural Courtesy shines through him , beautifying his vagaries ; like sunlight , making a rosyfingered , rainbow-dyed Aurora out of mere aqueous clouds ; nay brightening London-smoke itself into gold vapor , as from the crucible of an alchemist . Hear in what earnest though fantastic wise he expresses himself on this head : -- `` Shall Courtesy be done only to the rich , and only by the rich ? In Good-breeding , which differs , if at all , from High-breeding , only as it gracefully remembers the rights of others , rather than gracefully insists on its	1830
II . IDYLLIC . `` HAPPY season of Childhood ! '' exclaims Teufelsdrockh : `` Kind Nature , that art to all a bountiful mother ; that visitest the poor man 's hut with auroral radiance ; and for thy Nursling hast provided a soft swathing of Love and infinite Hope , wherein he waxes and slumbers , danced round ( _umgaukelt_ ) by sweetest Dreams ! If the paternal Cottage still shuts us in , its roof still screens us ; with a Father we have as yet a prophet , priest and king , and an Obedience that makes us free . The young spirit has awakened out of Eternity ,	1830
They worship principally by night ; and have their High-priests and High-priestesses , who , however , do not continue for life . The rites , by some supposed to be of the Menadic sort , or perhaps with an Eleusinian or Cabiric character , are held strictly secret . Nor are Sacred Books wanting to the Sect ; these they call _Fashionable Novels_ : however , the Canon is not completed , and some are canonical and others not . `` Of such Sacred Books I , not without expense , procured myself some samples ; and in hope of true insight , and with the zeal which beseems an Inquirer into Clothes , set to	1830
come , as is usual , various waste printed-sheets ( _Maculatur-blatter_ ) , by way of interior wrappage : into these the Clothes-Philosopher , with a certain Mahometan reverence even for waste-paper , where curious knowledge will sometimes hover , disdains not to cast his eye . Readers may judge of his astonishment when on such a defaced stray-sheet , probably the outcast fraction of some English Periodical , such as they name _Magazine_ , appears something like a Dissertation on this very subject of _Fashionable Novels_ ! It sets out , indeed , chiefly from a Secular point of view ; directing itself , not without asperity , against some to me unknown individual named _Pelham_ , who seems to be a Mystagogue , and leading Teacher and Preacher of the Sect ; so that	1830
as I often thought , would I have done it , had it been leaping into the infernal Fire . Thus , in spite of all Motive-grinders , and Mechanical Profit-and-Loss Philosophies , with the sick ophthalmia and hallucination they had brought on , was the Infinite nature of Duty still dimly present to me : living without God in the world , of God 's light I was not utterly bereft ; if my as yet sealed eyes , with their unspeakable longing , could nowhere see Him , nevertheless in my heart He was present , and His heaven-written Law still stood legible and sacred there . '' Meanwhile	1830
was it with the Editor 's mind and this offer of Heuschrecke 's . Form rose out of void solution and discontinuity ; like united itself with like in definite arrangement : and soon either in actual vision and possession , or in fixed reasonable hope , the image of the whole Enterprise had shaped itself , so to speak , into a solid mass . Cautiously yet courageously , through the twopenny post , application to the famed redoubtable OLIVER YORKE was now made : an interview , interviews with that singular man have taken place ; with more of assurance on our side , with less of satire ( at least of open satire ) on his , than we anticipated ; for the rest , with such issue as is now visible . As	1830
with equal fervor , as when it contained the Man : nay , with more , for I now fear no deception , of myself or of others . `` Did not King _Toomtabard_ , or , in other words , John Baliol , reign long over Scotland ; the man John Baliol being quite gone , and only the 'Toom Tabard ' ( Empty Gown ) remaining ? What still dignity dwells in a suit of Cast Clothes ! How meekly it bears its honors ! No haughty looks , no scornful gesture : silent and serene , it fronts the world ; neither demanding worship , nor afraid to miss it . The Hat still carries the physiognomy of its Head : but the vanity and the stupidity , and goose-speech which was the sign of these two , are gone . The Coat-arm	1830
know , to believe ; nay does not the spirit of Love , free in its celestial primeval brightness , even here , though but for moments , look through ? Well said Saint Chrysostom , with his lips of gold , 'the true SHEKINAH is Man : ' where else is the GOD'S-PRESENCE manifested not to our eyes only , but to our hearts , as in our fellow-man ? '' In such passages , unhappily too rare , the high Platonic Mysticism of our Author , which is perhaps the fundamental element of his nature , bursts forth , as it were , in full flood : and , through all the vapor and tarnish of what is often	1830
and grow , does at length appear there also ; and under curious phasis ; properly as the inconsiderable fag-end , and so far in the rear of the others as to fancy itself the van . Our European Mechanizers are a sect of boundless diffusion , activity , and co-operative spirit : has not Utilitarianism flourished in high places of Thought , here among ourselves , and in every European country , at some time or other , within the last fifty years ? If now in all countries , except perhaps England , it has ceased to flourish , or indeed to exist , among Thinkers , and sunk to Journalists and the popular mass , -- who sees not that , as hereby it no longer preaches , so the reason	1830
as _Ew . Wohlgeboren_ knows , was the public tranquillity here , as in Berlin , threatened by a Sedition of the Tailors . Nor did there want Evil-wishers , or perhaps mere desperate Alarmists , who asserted that the closing Chapter of the Clothes-Volume was to blame . In this appalling crisis , the serenity of our Philosopher was indescribable : nay , perhaps through one humble individual , something thereof might pass into the _Rath_ ( Council ) itself , and so contribute to the country 's deliverance . The Tailors are now entirely pacificated. -- `` To neither of these two incidents	1830
of such custom-woven , wonder-hiding Garments . Witchcraft , and all manner of Spectre-work , and Demonology , we have now named Madness , and Diseases of the Nerves . Seldom reflecting that still the new question comes upon us : What is Madness , what are Nerves ? Ever , as before , does Madness remain a mysterious-terrific , altogether _infernal_ boiling-up of the Nether Chaotic Deep , through this fair-painted Vision of Creation , which swims thereon , which we name the Real . Was Luther 's Picture of the Devil less a Reality , whether it were formed within the bodily eye , or without it ? In every the wisest Soul lies a whole world of internal Madness , an authentic Demon-Empire ; out of which , indeed , his world	1830
ill-starred individual by a rent in his breeches , -- for no Memoirist of Kaiser Otto 's Court omits him . Vain was the prayer of Themistocles for a talent of Forgetting : my Friends , yield cheerfully to Destiny , and read since it is written . '' -- Has Teufelsdrockh , to be put in mind that , nearly related to the impossible talent of Forgetting , stands that talent of Silence , which even travelling Englishmen manifest ? `` The simplest costume , '' observes our Professor , `` which I anywhere find alluded to in History , is that used as regimental , by Bolivar 's Cavalry , in the late Colombian wars . A square Blanket , twelve feet in diagonal , is provided ( some were wont to cut off the corners , and make	1830
. CHAPTER VI . OLD CLOTHES . As mentioned above , Teufelsdrockh , though a Sansculottist , is in practice probably the politest man extant : his whole heart and life are penetrated and informed with the spirit of politeness ; a noble natural Courtesy shines through him , beautifying his vagaries ; like sunlight , making a rosyfingered , rainbow-dyed Aurora out of mere aqueous clouds ; nay brightening London-smoke itself into gold vapor , as from the crucible of an alchemist . Hear in what earnest though fantastic wise he expresses himself on this head : -- `` Shall Courtesy be done only to the rich , and only by the rich ? In Good-breeding	1830
would Majesty do , could such an accident befall in reality ; should the buttons all simultaneously start , and the solid wool evaporate , in very Deed , as here in Dream ? _Ach Gott_ ! How each skulks into the nearest hiding-place ; their high State Tragedy ( _Haupt- und Staats-Action_ ) becomes a Pickleherring-Farce to weep at , which is the worst kind of Farce ; _the tables_ ( according to Horace ) , and with them , the whole fabric of Government , Legislation , Property , Police , and Civilized Society , _are dissolved_ , in wails and howls . '' Lives the man that can figure a naked Duke of Windlestraw addressing a naked House of Lords ? Imagination ,	1830
, and a return to the savage state : all this our readers are now bent to discover ; this is , in fact , properly the gist and purport of Professor Teufelsdrockh 's Philosophy of Clothes . Be it remembered , however , that such purport is here not so much evolved , as detected to lie ready for evolving . We are to guide our British Friends into the new Gold-country , and show them the mines ; nowise to dig out and exhaust its wealth , which indeed remains for all time inexhaustible . Once there , let each dig for his own behoof	1830
himself . One BIBLE I know , of whose Plenary Inspiration doubt is not so much as possible ; nay with my own eyes I saw the God's-Hand writing it : thereof all other Bibles are but Leaves , -- say , in Picture-Writing to assist the weaker faculty . '' Or , to give the wearied reader relief , and bring it to an end , let him take the following perhaps more intelligible passage : -- `` To me , in this our life , '' says the Professor , `` which is an internecine warfare with the Time-spirit , other warfare seems questionable . Hast thou in any way a contention with thy brother , I advise thee , think well what the meaning thereof is . If thou gauge it to the bottom , it	1830
green with Carmen , '' and the Kings being thrown : `` dissect them with scalpels , '' says Teufelsdrockh ; `` the same viscera , tissues , livers , lights , and other life-tackle , are there : examine their spiritual mechanism ; the same great Need , great Greed , and little Faculty ; nay ten to one but the Carman , who understands draught-cattle , the rimming of wheels , something of the laws of unstable and stable equilibrium , with other branches of wagon-science , and has actually put forth his hand and operated on Nature , is the more cunningly gifted of the	1830
as dead stuff , but as living pabulum , tolerably nutritive for a mind as yet so peptic . '' That the Entepfuhl Schoolmaster judged well , we now know . Indeed , already in the youthful Gneschen , with all his outward stillness , there may have been manifest an inward vivacity that promised much ; symptoms of a spirit singularly open , thoughtful , almost poetical . Thus , to say nothing of his Suppers on the Orchard-wall , and other phenomena of that earlier period , have many readers of these pages stumbled , in their twelfth year , on such reflections as the following ? `` It struck me much , as I sat by the Kuhbach , one silent noontide , and watched it flowing , gurgling , to think how this same streamlet had flowed and gurgled , through all changes	1830
, Sentences , and grand descriptive Pages , poetical and philosophical , spread out through Solar Systems , and Thousands of Years , we shall not try thee . It is a Volume written in celestial hieroglyphs , in the true Sacred-writing ; of which even Prophets are happy that they can read here a line and there a line . As for your Institutes , and Academies of Science , they strive bravely ; and , from amid the thick-crowded , inextricably intertwisted hieroglyphic writing , pick out , by dexterous combination , some Letters in the vulgar Character , and therefrom put together this and the other economic Recipe , of high avail in Practice . That Nature is more than some boundless Volume of such Recipes , or huge , well-nigh	1830
buttoned . The maidens have bound silver snoods about their hair , with gold spangles , and pendent flames ( _Flammen_ ) , that is , sparkling hair-drops : but of their mother 's head-gear who shall speak ? Neither in love of grace is comfort forgotten . In winter weather you behold the whole fair creation ( that can afford it ) in long mantles , with skirts wide below , and , for hem , not one but two sufficient hand-broad welts ; all ending atop in a thick well-starched Ruff , some twenty inches broad : these are their Ruff-mantles ( _Kragenmantel_ ) . `` As yet among the womankind hoop-petticoats are not ; but the men have doublets of fustian , under which lie	1830
the muscle itself seems osseous ; some are even quite pallid , hunger-bitten and dead-looking ; while others again glow in the flush of health and vigorous self-growth , sometimes ( as in my own case ) not without an apoplectic tendency . Moreover , there are sham Metaphors , which overhanging that same Thought's-Body ( best naked ) , and deceptively bedizening , or bolstering it out , may be called its false stuffings , superfluous show-cloaks ( _Putz-Mantel_ ) , and tawdry woollen rags : whereof he that runs and reads may gather whole hampers , -- and burn them . '' Than which paragraph on Metaphors did the reader ever chance to see a more surprisingly metaphorical ? However , that is not our chief grievance ; the Professor continues : --	1830
gainsayers , as he had from hers , gathered wonder , gathered favor for him ? Was the attraction , the agitation mutual , then ; pole and pole trembling towards contact , when once brought into neighborhood ? Say rather , heart swelling in presence of the Queen of Hearts ; like the Sea swelling when once near its Moon ! With the Wanderer it was even so : as in heavenward gravitation , suddenly as at the touch of a Seraph 's wand , his whole soul is roused from its deepest recesses ; and all that was painful and that was blissful there , dim images , vague feelings of a whole Past and a whole Future , are heaving in unquiet eddies within him	1830
the ruins as of a shivered Universe was he falling , falling , towards the Abyss . '' CHAPTER VI . SORROWS OF TEUFELSDROCKH . We have long felt that , with a man like our Professor , matters must often be expected to take a course of their own ; that in so multiplex , intricate a nature , there might be channels , both for admitting and emitting , such as the Psychologist had seldom noted ; in short , that on no grand occasion and convulsion , neither in the joy-storm nor in the woe-storm could you predict his demeanor . To our less philosophical readers , for example , it is now clear that the so passionate Teufelsdrockh precipitated through `` a shivered Universe '' in this extraordinary way ,	1830
his secluded way of life , and with his glowing Fantasy , the more fiery that it burnt under cover , as in a reverberating furnace , his feeling towards the Queens of this Earth was , and indeed is , altogether unspeakable . A visible Divinity dwelt in them ; to our young Friend all women were holy , were heavenly . As yet he but saw them flitting past , in their many-colored angel-plumage ; or hovering mute and inaccessible on the outskirts of _AEsthetic Tea_ : all of air they were , all Soul and Form ; so lovely , like mysterious	1830
, when the Godlike showed itself revealed in his fellow-man . Thus is there a true religious Loyalty forever rooted in his heart ; nay in all ages , even in ours , it manifests itself as a more or less orthodox _Hero-worship_ . In which fact , that Hero-worship exists , has existed , and will forever exist , universally among Mankind , mayest thou discern the corner-stone of living rock , whereon all Polities for the remotest time may stand secure . '' Do our readers discern any such corner-stone , or even so much as what Teufelsdrockh , is looking at ? He exclaims , `` Or hast thou forgotten Paris and Voltaire ? How the aged , withered man , though but a Sceptic , Mocker ,	1830
and quartered : motley , not unterrific was the aspect ; but we looked on it like brave youths . For myself , these were perhaps my most genial hours . Towards this young warm-hearted , strong-headed and wrong-headed Herr Towgood I was even near experiencing the now obsolete sentiment of Friendship . Yes , foolish Heathen that I was , I felt that , under certain conditions , I could have loved this man , and taken him to my bosom , and been his brother once and always . By degrees , however , I understood the new time , and its wants . If man 's _Soul_ is indeed , as in the Finnish Language , and Utilitarian Philosophy , a	1830
can create provision enough for the body ( of a Philosopher ) ; and then , as with both hands , create quite other than provision ; namely , spectres to torment itself withal . '' Poor Teufelsdrockh ! Flying with Hunger always parallel to him ; and a whole Infernal Chase in his rear ; so that the countenance of Hunger is comparatively a friend 's ! Thus must he , in the temper of ancient Cain , or of the modern Wandering Jew , -- save only that he feels himself not guilty and but suffering the pains of guilt , -- wend to and fro with aimless speed . Thus must he , over the whole surface	1830
. Generations are as the Days of toilsome Mankind : Death and Birth are the vesper and the matin bells , that summon Mankind to sleep , and to rise refreshed for new advancement . What the Father has made , the Son can make and enjoy ; but has also work of his own appointed him . Thus all things wax , and roll onwards ; Arts , Establishments , Opinions , nothing is completed , but ever completing . Newton has learned to see what Kepler saw ; but there is also a fresh heaven-derived force in Newton ; he must mount to still higher points of vision . So too the Hebrew Lawgiver is , in due time , followed by an Apostle of the Gentiles . In the business of Destruction , as this also is	1830
there dwelt a very seraph . Then again he is so sly and still , so imperturbably saturnine ; shows such indifference , malign coolness towards all that men strive after ; and ever with some half-visible wrinkle of a bitter sardonic humor , if indeed it be not mere stolid callousness , -- that you look on him almost with a shudder , as on some incarnate Mephistopheles , to whom this great terrestrial and celestial Round , after all , were but some huge foolish Whirligig , where kings and beggars , and angels and demons , and stars and street-sweepings , were chaotically whirled , in which only children could take interest . His look , as we mentioned , is probably the gravest ever seen : yet it	1830
accordingly , his aspect is rather generic , that of an incipient Philosopher and Poet in the abstract ; perhaps it would puzzle Herr Heuschrecke himself to say wherein the special Doctrine of Clothes is as yet foreshadowed or betokened . For with Gneschen , as with others , the Man may indeed stand pictured in the Boy ( at least all the pigments are there ) ; yet only some half of the Man stands in the Child , or young Boy , namely , his Passive endowment , not his Active . The more impatient are we to discover what figure he cuts in this latter capacity ; how , when , to use his own words , `` he understands the tools a little , and can handle this or that , '' he will proceed	1830
: '' have we not here the components of driest Gunpowder , ready , on occasion of the smallest spark , to blaze up ? Neither , in this our Life-element , are sparks anywhere wanting . Without doubt , some Angel , whereof so many hovered round , would one day , leaving `` the outskirts of _AEsthetic Tea_ , '' flit higher ; and , by electric Promethean glance , kindle no despicable firework . Happy , if it indeed proved a Firework , and flamed off rocket-wise , in successive beautiful bursts of splendor , each growing naturally from the other , through the several stages	1830
or relish of any kind , save an unknown condiment named _Point_ , into the meaning of which I have vainly inquired ; the victual _Potatoes-and-Point_ not appearing , at least not with specific accuracy of description , in any European Cookery-Book whatever . For drink , they use , with an almost epigrammatic counterpoise of taste , Milk , which is the mildest of liquors , and _Potheen_ , which is the fiercest . This latter I have tasted , as well as the English _Blue-Ruin_ , and the Scotch _Whiskey_ , analogous fluids used by the Sect in those countries : it evidently contains some form of alcohol , in the highest state of concentration , though disguised with	1830
, yet ready , if stirred , to ring quaintest changes . `` Silence as of death , '' writes he ; `` for Midnight , even in the Arctic latitudes , has its character : nothing but the granite cliffs ruddy-tinged , the peaceable gurgle of that slow-heaving Polar Ocean , over which in the utmost North the great Sun hangs low and lazy , as if he too were slumbering . Yet is his cloud-couch wrought of crimson and cloth-of-gold ; yet does his light stream over the mirror of waters , like a tremulous fire-pillar , shooting downwards to the abyss , and hide itself under my feet . In such moments , Solitude also is invaluable ; for who would speak , or be looked on , when behind him lies all Europe and Africa , fast asleep , except the watchmen ; and before	1830
others lie close-folded and continue dunces . Herein , say they , consists the whole difference between an inspired Prophet and a double-barrelled Game-preserver : the inner man of the one has been fostered into generous development ; that of the other , crushed down perhaps by vigor of animal digestion , and the like , has exuded and evaporated , or at best sleeps now irresuscitably stagnant at the bottom of his stomach . `` With which opinion , '' cries Teufelsdrockh , `` I should as soon agree as with this other , that an acorn might , by favorable or	1830
we but clear it , takes us safe into the promised land , where _Palingenesia_ , in all senses , may be considered as beginning . `` Courage , then ! '' may our Diogenes exclaim , with better right than Diogenes the First once did . This stupendous Section we , after long painful meditation , have found not to be unintelligible ; but , on the contrary , to grow clear , nay radiant , and all-illuminating . Let the reader , turning on it what utmost force of speculative intellect is in him , do his part ; as we , by judicious selection and adjustment , shall study to do ours : -- `` Deep has been , and is , the significance of Miracles , '' thus quietly begins the Professor ; `` far deeper perhaps than we imagine . Meanwhile , the question of	1830
masses of a rugged , gigantic character ; which ruggedness , however , is here tempered by a singular airiness of form , and softness of environment : in a climate favorable to vegetation , the gray cliff , itself covered with lichens , shoots up through a garment of foliage or verdure ; and white , bright cottages , tree-shaded , cluster round the everlasting granite . In fine vicissitude , Beauty alternates with Grandeur : you ride through stony hollows , along strait passes , traversed by torrents , overhung by high walls of rock ; now winding amid broken shaggy chasms , and huge fragments ; now suddenly emerging into some emerald valley , where the streamlet collects itself into a Lake , and man has again found a fair dwelling , and it seems as if Peace had established herself in	1830
the secret depths of English national Existence ; striving to separate and isolate it into two contradictory , uncommunicating masses . `` In numbers , and even individual strength , the Poor-Slaves or Drudges , it would seem , are hourly increasing . The Dandiacal , again , is by nature no proselytizing Sect ; but it boasts of great hereditary resources , and is strong by union ; whereas the Drudges , split into parties , have as yet no rallying-point ; or at best only co-operate by means of partial secret affiliations . If , indeed , there were to arise a _Communion of Drudges_ , as there is already a Communion of Saints , what strangest effects would follow	1830
worst that lies before thee ? Death ? Well , Death ; and say the pangs of Tophet too , and all that the Devil and Man may , will or can do against thee ! Hast thou not a heart ; canst thou not suffer whatsoever it be ; and , as a Child of Freedom , though outcast , trample Tophet itself under thy feet , while it consumes thee ? Let it come , then ; I will meet it and defy it ! ' And as I so thought , there rushed like a stream of fire over my whole soul ; and I shook base Fear away from me forever . I was strong , of unknown strength	1830
greedily down below . What argument will avail ? On the thick Hyperborean , cherubic reasoning , seraphic eloquence were lost . Prepared for such extremity , I , deftly enough , whisk aside one step ; draw out , from my interior reservoirs , a sufficient Birmingham Horse-pistol , and say , 'Be so obliging as retire , Friend ( _Er ziehe sich zuruck , Freund_ ) , and with promptitude ! ' This logic even the Hyperborean understands : fast enough , with apologetic , petitionary growl , he sidles off ; and , except for suicidal as well as homicidal purposes , need not return . `` Such I hold to be the genuine use	1830
from the passive Auscultatorship , towards any active Assessorship , is evidently of the slowest . By degrees , those same established men , once partially inclined to patronize him , seem to withdraw their countenance , and give him up as `` a man of genius '' against which procedure he , in these Papers , loudly protests . `` As if , '' says he , `` the higher did not presuppose the lower ; as if he who can fly into heaven , could not also walk post if he resolved on it ! But the world	1830

Consider their welts , a handbreadth thick , which waver round them by way of hem ; the long flood of silver buttons , or rather silver shells , from throat to shoe , wherewith these same welt-gowns are buttoned . The maidens have bound silver snoods about their hair , with gold spangles , and pendent flames ( _Flammen_ ) , that is , sparkling hair-drops : but of their mother 's head-gear who shall speak ? Neither in love of grace is comfort forgotten . In winter weather you behold the whole fair creation ( that can afford	1830
born purely a Loghead ( _Dummkopf_ ) , thou hadst no other outlook . The whole world is , like thee , sold to Unbelief ; their old Temples of the Godhead , which for long have not been rain-proof , crumble down ; and men ask now : Where is the Godhead ; our eyes never saw him ? '' Pitiful enough were it , for all these wild utterances , to call our Diogenes wicked . Unprofitable servants as we all are , perhaps at no era of his life was he more decisively the Servant of Goodness , the Servant of God , than even now when doubting God 's existence . `` One circumstance I note , '' says he : `` after all the nameless woe that Inquiry , which for	1830
's nature , or of boy 's ; or of aught save their lexicons and quarterly account-books . Innumerable dead Vocables ( no dead Language , for they themselves knew no Language ) they crammed into us , and called it fostering the growth of mind . How can an inanimate , mechanical Gerund-grinder , the like of whom will , in a subsequent century , be manufactured at Nurnberg out of wood and leather , foster the growth of anything ; much more of Mind , which grows , not like a vegetable ( by having its roots littered with etymological compost ) ,	1830
matter about _Perfectibility_ , has seemed worth clutching at : -- `` Perhaps the most remarkable incident in Modern History , '' says Teufelsdrockh , `` is not the Diet of Worms , still less the Battle of Austerlitz , Waterloo , Peterloo , or any other Battle ; but an incident passed carelessly over by most Historians , and treated with some degree of ridicule by others : namely , George Fox 's making to himself a suit of Leather . This man , the first of the Quakers , and by trade a Shoemaker , was one of those , to whom , under ruder or purer form , the Divine Idea of the Universe is pleased to manifest itself ; and , across all the hulls of Ignorance and	1830
are too often unknown , or what is worse , misknown . Already , when we dreamed not of it , the warp of thy remarkable Volume lay on the loom ; and silently , mysterious shuttles were putting in the woof . How the Hofrath Heuschrecke is to furnish biographical data , in this case , may be a curious question ; the answer of which , however , is happily not our concern , but his . To us it appeared , after repeated trial , that in Weissnichtwo , from the archives or memories of the best-informed classes , no Biography of Teufelsdrockh was to be gathered	1830
to the Inevitable and Inexorable , and accounted even this the best . '' Nay , might not an attentive Editor , drawing his own inferences from what stands written , conjecture that Teufelsdrockh , individually had yielded to this same `` Inevitable and Inexorable '' heartily enough ; and now sat waiting the issue , with his natural diabolico-angelical Indifference , if not even Placidity ? Did we not hear him complain that the World was a `` huge Ragfair , '' and the `` rags and tatters of old Symbols '' were raining down everywhere , like to drift him in , and suffocate him ? What with those `` unhunted Helots '' of his ; and the uneven _sic vos non vobis_ pressure and hard-crashing collision he is pleased to discern in existing	1830
out on the broader parts of the body , by introduction of Bran , -- our Professor fails not to comment on that luckless Courtier , who having seated himself on a chair with some projecting nail on it , and therefrom rising , to pay his _devoir_ on the entrance of Majesty , instantaneously emitted several pecks of dry wheat-dust : and stood there diminished to a spindle , his galloons and slashes dangling sorrowful and flabby round him . Whereupon the Professor publishes this reflection : -- `` By what strange chances do we live in History ? Erostratus	1830
loneliness , has Fantasy turned , full of longing ( _sehnsuchtsvoll_ ) , to that unknown Father , who perhaps far from me , perhaps near , either way invisible , might have taken me to his paternal bosom , there to lie screened from many a woe . Thou beloved Father , dost thou still , shut out from me only by thin penetrable curtains of earthly Space , wend to and fro among the crowd of the living ? Or art thou hidden by those far thicker curtains of the Everlasting Night , or rather of the Everlasting Day , through which my mortal eye and outstretched arms need not strive to reach ? Alas , I know not , and in vain vex myself to know	1830
in honor , so we will not doubt him : but seems it not conceivable that , by the `` good Gretchen Futteral , '' or some other perhaps interested party , he has himself been deceived ? Should these sheets , translated or not , ever reach the Entepfuhl Circulating Library , some cultivated native of that district might feel called to afford explanation . Nay , since Books , like invisible scouts , permeate the whole habitable globe , and Timbuctoo itself is not safe from British Literature , may not some Copy find out even the mysterious basket-bearing Stranger , who in a state of extreme senility perhaps still exists ; and gently force even him to disclose himself ;	1830
Treatises of what you call Political Economy , are the Meal ? And what is that Science , which the scientific head alone , were it screwed off , and ( like the Doctor 's in the Arabian Tale ) set in a basin to keep it alive , could prosecute without shadow of a heart , -- but one other of the mechanical and menial handicrafts , for which the Scientific Head ( having a Soul in it ) is too noble an organ ?

Quitting the common Fleet of herring-busses and whalers , where indeed his leeward , laggard condition was painful enough , he desperately steers off , on a course of his own , by sextant and compass of his own . Unhappy Teufelsdrockh ! Though neither Fleet , nor Traffic , nor Commodores pleased thee , still was it not _a Fleet_ , sailing in prescribed track , for fixed objects ; above all , in combination , wherein , by mutual guidance , by all manner of loans and borrowings , each could manifoldly aid the other ? How	1830
had now reached ; through which whoso travels from the Negative Pole to the Positive must necessarily pass . '' CHAPTER IX . THE EVERLASTING YEA . `` Temptations in the Wilderness ! '' exclaims Teufelsdrockh , `` Have we not all to be tried with such ? Not so easily can the old Adam , lodged in us by birth , be dispossessed . Our Life is compassed round with Necessity ; yet is the meaning of Life itself no other than Freedom , than Voluntary Force : thus have we a warfare ; in the beginning , especially , a hard-fought battle . For the God-given mandate , _Work thou in Well-doing_ , lies mysteriously written , in Promethean Prophetic Characters , in	1830

Moreover , in the so precious waste-paper sheet above mentioned , I have found some corresponding picture of a Dandiacal Household , painted by that same Dandiacal Mystagogue , or Theogonist : this also , by way of counterpart and contrast , the world shall look into . `` First , therefore , of the Poor-Slave , who appears likewise to have been a species of Innkeeper . I quote from the original : POOR-SLAVE HOUSEHOLD . `` 'The furniture of this Caravansera consisted of a large iron Pot , two oaken Tables , two Benches , two Chairs , and a Potheen Noggin . There was a Loft above ( attainable by a ladder ) , upon which the inmates slept ; and the space below was divided by a hurdle into two Apartments ; the one for their cow and pig , the other for themselves	1830

That warrior on his strong war-horse , fire flashes through his eyes ; force dwells in his arm and heart : but warrior and war-horse are a vision ; a revealed Force , nothing more . Stately they tread the Earth , as if it were a firm substance : fool ! the Earth is but a film ; it cracks in twain , and warrior and war-horse sink beyond plummet 's sounding . Plummet 's ?

dawn of day or dusk of utter darkness . For the last week , these so-called Biographical Documents are in his hand . By the kindness of a Scottish Hamburg Merchant , whose name , known to the whole mercantile world , he must not mention ; but whose honorable courtesy , now and often before spontaneously manifested to him , a mere literary stranger , he can not soon forget , -- the bulky Weissnichtwo Packet , with all its Custom-house seals , foreign hieroglyphs , and miscellaneous tokens of Travel , arrived here in perfect safety , and free of cost . The reader shall now fancy with what hot haste it was broken up , with what breathless expectation glanced over ; and , alas , with what	1830
repeated speech of the Magician , Shakespeare , -- `` And like the baseless fabric of this vision , The cloud-capt Towers , the gorgeous Palaces , The solemn Temples , the great Globe itself , And all which it inherit , shall dissolve ; And like this unsubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a wrack behind ; '' begin to have some meaning for us ? In a word , do we at length stand safe in the far region of Poetic Creation and Palingenesia , where that Phoenix Death-Birth of Human Society , and of all Human Things , appears possible , is seen to be inevitable ? Along this most insufficient , unheard-of Bridge , which the Editor , by Heaven 's blessing , has now seen himself enabled	1830
stair-steps , in short , and subterranean passages , and sloughs of Despair , and steep Pisgah hills , has he reached this wonderful prophetic Hebron ( a true Old-Clothes Jewry ) where he now dwells ? `` To all these natural questions the voice of public History is as yet silent . Certain only that he has been , and is , a Pilgrim , and Traveller from a far Country ; more or less footsore and travel-soiled ; has parted with road-companions ; fallen among thieves , been poisoned by bad cookery , blistered with bug-bites ; nevertheless , at every stage ( for they have let him pass ) , has had the Bill to discharge . But the whole particulars of his Route , his Weather-observations , the picturesque Sketches he took ,	1830

First , therefore , this of Mankind in general : -- `` In vain thou deniest it , '' says the Professor ; `` thou art my Brother .

have been abolished , Whig , Tory , and Radical , embracing in discrepant union ; and all the Journals of the Nation could have been jumbled into one Journal , and the Philosophy of Clothes poured forth in incessant torrents therefrom , the attempt had seemed possible . But , alas , what vehicle of that sort have we , except _Fraser 's Magazine_ ? A vehicle all strewed ( figuratively speaking ) with the maddest Waterloo-Crackers , exploding distractively and destructively , wheresoever the mystified passenger stands or sits ; nay , in any case , understood to be , of late years , a vehicle full to overflowing , and	1830

Can many readers discern , as through a glass darkly , in huge wavering outlines , some primeval rudiments of Man 's Being , what is changeable divided from what is unchangeable ? Does that Earth-Spirit 's speech in _Faust_ , -- `` 'T is thus at the roaring Loom of Time I ply , And weave for God the Garment thou seest Him by ; `` or that other thousand-times repeated speech of the Magician , Shakespeare , -- `` And like the baseless fabric of this vision , The cloud-capt Towers , the gorgeous Palaces , The solemn Temples , the great Globe itself , And all which it inherit , shall dissolve ; And like this unsubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a wrack behind ; '' begin to have some meaning for us ?

'' We ask : Has this same `` perhaps not ill-written _Program_ , '' or any other authentic Transaction of that Property-conserving Society , fallen under the eye of the British Reader , in any Journal foreign or domestic ? If so , what are those _Prize-Questions_ ; what are the terms of Competition , and when and where ? No printed Newspaper-leaf , no farther light of any sort , to be met with in these Paper-bags ! Or is the whole business one other of those whimsicalities and perverse inexplicabilities , whereby Herr Teufelsdrockh , meaning much or nothing , is pleased so often to	1830
faithful portrait of its inhabitants . All the features in the foregoing sketch were taken from the life , and they are characteristic of that mixture of quickness , simplicity , cunning , carelessness , dissipation , disinterestedness , shrewdness , and blunder , which , in different forms and with various success , has been brought upon the stage or delineated in novels . It is a problem of difficult solution to determine whether a union will hasten or retard the amelioration of this country . The few gentlemen of education who now reside in this country will resort to England . They are few , but they are in nothing inferior to men of the same rank in Great Britain . The best that can happen will be the introduction of British manufacturers in their places . Did the Warwickshire militia , who were chiefly artisans	1800
to dinner together . This gentleman , to show the world how they stood together , and by the advice of the friends of both parties , to re-establish his sister ’ s injured reputation , went out with Sir Kit as his second , and carried his message next day to the last of his adversaries : I never saw him in such fine spirits as that day he went out -- sure enough he was within ames-ace of getting quit handsomely of all his enemies ; but unluckily , after hitting the toothpick out of his adversary ’ s finger and thumb , he received a ball in a vital part , and was	1800
have sufficient taste , wickedness , or heroism , to sympathise in their fate . Besides , there is much uncertainty even in the best authenticated ancient or modern histories ; and that love of truth , which in some minds is innate and immutable , necessarily leads to a love of secret memoirs and private anecdotes . We can not judge either of the feelings or of the characters of men with perfect accuracy , from their actions or their appearance in public ; it is from their careless conversations , their half-finished sentences , that we may hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real characters . The life of a great or of a little man written by himself , the familiar letters	1800
, is not the whisky-punch , jug and bowl and all , gone out of the room long ago ? What is it , in the wide world , you have to complain of ? ’ But still my lady sobbed and sobbed , and called herself the most wretched of women ; and among other out-of-the-way provoking things , asked my master , was he fit company for her , and he drinking all night ? This nettling him , which it was hard to do , he replied , that as to drinking all night , he was then as sober as she was herself , and that it was no matter how much a man drank , provided it did noways affect or stagger him : that as to being fit company for her , he thought himself of a family to be fit company for	1800
some tenant ’ s pig , or horse , or cow , or calf , or goose , trespassing , which was so great a gain to Sir Murtagh , that he did not like to hear me talk of repairing fences . Then his heriots and duty-work [ 9 ] brought him in something , his turf was cut , his potatoes set and dug , his hay brought home , and , in short , all the work about his house done for nothing ; for in all our leases there were strict clauses heavy with penalties , which Sir Murtagh knew well how to enforce ; so many days ’ duty-work of man and horse , from every tenant , he was to have , and had , every year ; and when a	1800
says my lady , and another sigh , which made my master , half-shaved as he was , turn round upon her in surprise . ‘ Why , Bell , ’ says he , ‘ you can ’ t deny what you know as well as I do , that it was at your own particular desire , and that twice under your own hand and seal expressed , that I should carry you off as I did to Scotland , and marry you there. ’ ‘ Well , say no more about it , Sir Condy , ’ said my lady , pettish-like ; ‘ I was a child then , you know. ’ ‘ And as far as I know , you ’ re little better now , my dear	1800
your time , and been proud to do it , till his honour was at leisure to speak to you . His honour , ’ says I , raising my voice , at which his honour wakens of his own accord , and calls to me from the room to know who it was I was speaking to . Jason made no more ceremony , but follows me into the room . ‘ How are you , Sir Condy ? ’ says he ; ‘ I ’ m happy to see you looking so well ; I came up to know how you did to-day ,	1800
were less than other people ’ s , or less than the usual size . LITTLE is here used only as an Italian diminutive , expressive of fondness . Now I could not bear to hear Jason giving out after this manner against the family , and twenty people standing by in the street . Ever since he had lived at the Lodge of his own he looked down , howsomever , upon poor old Thady , and was grown quite a great gentleman , and had none of his relations near him ; no wonder he was no kinder to poor Sir Condy than to his own kith or kin . { 18 } In	1800
varies according to circumstances , but it is never earlier than twelve o ’ clock at night ; the joys of a raking pot of tea depending on its being made in secret , and at an unseasonable hour . After a ball , when the more discreet part of the company has departed to rest , a few chosen female spirits , who have footed it till they can foot it no longer , and till the sleepy notes expire under the slurring hand of the musician , retire to a bedchamber , call the favourite maid , who alone is admitted , bid her PUT DOWN THE KETTLE , lock the door , and	1800
THE FAMILY , in which he was bred and born , must be obvious to the reader . He tells the history of the Rackrent family in his vernacular idiom , and in the full confidence that Sir Patrick , Sir Murtagh , Sir Kit , and Sir Condy Rackrent ’ s affairs will be as interesting to all the world as they were to himself . Those who were acquainted with the manners of a certain class of the gentry of Ireland some years ago , will want no evidence of the truth of honest Thady ’ s narrative ; to those who are totally unacquainted with Ireland , the following Memoirs will	1800
composed the bed , whether it has been contained in a bag to form a mattress , or simply spread upon the earthen floor , is immediately taken out of the house , and burned before the cabin door , the family at the same time setting up the death howl . The ears and eyes of the neighbours being thus alarmed , they flock to the house of the deceased , and by their vociferous sympathy excite and at the same time soothe the sorrows of the family . It is curious to observe how good and bad are mingled in human institutions . In	1800
was a great throng of people , men , women , and childer , and there being only two rooms at the Lodge , except what was locked up full of Jason ’ s furniture and things , the house was soon as full and fuller than it could hold , and the heat , and smoke , and noise wonderful great ; and standing amongst them that were near the bed , but not thinking at all of the dead , I was startled by the sound of my master ’ s voice from under the greatcoats that had been thrown all at top , and I went close up , no one noticing . ‘ Thady , ’ says he , ‘ I ’ ve had enough of this ; I ’ m smothering , and can ’ t	1800
a succession of distinguished friends . Here , above all , we had the opportunity of seeing in what universal respect and comfort a gentleman ’ s family may live in that country , provided only they live there habitually and do their duty . . . . Here we found neither mud hovels nor naked peasantry , but snug cottages and smiling faces all about . . . . Here too we pleased ourselves with recognising some of the sweetest features in Goldsmith ’ s picture of “ Sweet Auburn ! loveliest village of the plain. ” ’ Oliver Goldsmith received	1800
Juliet ’ s Town , who had a great estate in the next county to ours ; and my master was loth to disoblige the young gentleman , whose heart was set upon the Lodge ; so he wrote him back that the Lodge was at his service , and if he would honour him with his company at Castle Rackrent , they could ride over together some morning and look at it before signing the lease . Accordingly , the captain came over to us , and he and Sir Condy grew the greatest friends ever you see , and were for ever out a-shooting or hunting together , and were very merry in the evenings ; and Sir Condy was invited of course to Mount Juliet ’ s Town ;	1800
that he was a real gentleman ; this phrase comprises a good deal in the opinion of the lower Irish. ’ There is one very curious paragraph in which Miss Edgeworth describes how her father knew how to make use of the tenants ’ prejudices , putting forward his wishes rather than his convictions . ‘ It would be impossible for me , ’ says his daughter , ‘ without ostentation to give any of the proofs I might record of my father ’ s liberality . Long after they were forgotten by himself , they were remembered by the warm-hearted people among whom he lived. ’ Mr. Edgeworth was one of those people	1800
to have been unconventional and spirited always . There are records still extant in the present Mr. Edgeworth ’ s possession , -- papers of most wonderful vitality for parchment , -- where you may read passionate remonstrances and adjurations from great-grandfathers to great-great-grandfathers , and where great-great-grandmothers rush into the discussion with vehement spelling and remonstrance , and make matters no better by their interference . I never read more passionately eloquent letters and appeals .

went out of the parlour to report it all to the kitchen . The next morning my lady and Mrs. Jane set out for Mount Juliet ’ s Town in the jaunting-car . Many wondered at my lady ’ s choosing to go away , considering all things , upon the jaunting-car , as if it was only a party of pleasure ; but they did not know till I told them that the coach was all broke in the journey down , and no other vehicle but the car to be had . Besides , my lady ’ s friends were to send their coach to meet her at the cross-roads ; so it was all done very proper	1800

right way , by reason of the ruins. ’ ‘ Plato , thou reasonest well ! ’ said she , or words to that effect , which I could noways understand ; and again , when her foot stumbled against a broken bit of a car-wheel , she cried out , ‘ Angels and ministers of grace defend us ! ’ Well , thought I , to be sure , if she ’ s no Jewish , like the last , she is a mad woman for certain , which is as bad : it would have been as well for my poor master to have taken up with poor Judy , who is in her right mind anyhow . She was dressed like a mad woman , moreover , more than like any one I ever saw afore	1800
real punishment of vice . That the great are not as happy as they seem , that the external circumstances of fortune and rank do not constitute felicity , is asserted by every moralist : the historian can seldom , consistently with his dignity , pause to illustrate this truth ; it is therefore to the biographer we must have recourse . After we have beheld splendid characters playing their parts on the great theatre of the world , with all the advantages of stage effect and decoration , we anxiously beg to be admitted behind the scenes , that we may take	1800

But Sir Condy all this time , and a great while afterwards , was at a terrible	1800
certain knowledge , and the other half was not fit for the cattle to touch ; but the bargain was made the week before the election , and the coach and saddle-horses were got into order for the day , besides a vote fairly got by them oats ; so no more reasoning on that head . But then there was no end to them that were telling Sir Condy he had engaged to make their sons excisemen , or high constables , or the like ; and as for them that had bills to give in for liquor , and beds , and straw , and ribands , and horses , and post-chaises for the gentlemen freeholders that came	1800
my own share to complain of , for the agent was always very civil to me when he came down into the country , and took a great deal of notice of my son Jason . Jason Quirk , though he be my son , I must say was a good scholar from his birth , and a very ‘ cute lad : I thought to make him a priest , [ 18 ] but he did better for himself ; seeing how he was as good a clerk as any in the county , the agent gave him his rent accounts to copy , which he did first of all for the pleasure of obliging the gentleman , and would take nothing at all for his trouble , but was always proud to serve the family . By and by a good farm bounding us to the east	1800
friend , and the giant was cheered and made welcome by her charming hospitality . It was a last gleam of sunshine in that noble life . We instinctively feel how happy they all were in each other ’ s good company . We can almost overhear some of their talk , as they walk together under the shade of the trees of the park . One can imagine him laughing in his delightful hearty way , half joking , half caressing . Lockhart had used some phrase ( it is Lockhart who tells us the story ) which conveyed the impression that he suspects poets and novelists of looking at life and at the world chiefly as materials for art . ‘ A soft and pensive shade came over Scott ’ s face	1800
’ Quirk ? ’ says Sir Condy , very easy , yet high like . ‘ None that ’ s news to you , Sir Condy , I hear , ’ says Jason . ‘ I am sorry to hear of my Lady Rackrent ’ s accident. ’ ‘ I ’ m much obliged to you , and so is her ladyship , I ’ m sure , ’ answered Sir Condy , still stiff ; and there was another sort of a silence , which seemed to lie the heaviest on my son Jason . ‘ Sir Condy , ’ says he at last , seeing Sir Condy disposing himself to go to sleep again , ‘ Sir Condy , I daresay you recollect mentioning to me the	1800
‘ It would be endless to enumerate the distinguished persons who , morning after morning , crowded to his levee in St. Stephen ’ s Green , ’ says Lockhart , and he quotes an old saying of Sir Robert Peel ’ s , ‘ that Sir Walter ’ s reception in the High Street of Edinburgh in was the first thing that gave him ( Peel ) a notion of the electric shock of a nation ’ s gratitude. ’ ‘ I doubt if even that scene surpassed what I myself witnessed , ’ continues the biographer , ‘ when Sir Walter returned down Dame Street after inspecting the Castle of Dublin. ’ From ovations to	1800
] All on a sudden he stopped , and my lady too . Something has surely happened , thought I ; and so it was , for Sir Murtagh in his passion broke a blood-vessel , and all the law in the land could do nothing in that case . My lady sent for five physicians , but Sir Murtagh died , and was buried . She had a fine jointure settled upon her , and took herself away , to the great joy of the tenantry . I never said anything one way or the other whilst she was part of the family , but got up to see her go at three o ’ clock in the morning . { 4	1800

All this the butler told me , who was going backwards and forwards unnoticed with the jug , and hot water ,	1800
his education chiefly in the college of Dublin , but before he came to years of discretion lived in the country , in a small but slated house within view of the end of the avenue . I remember him , bare footed and headed , running through the street of O ’ Shaughlin ’ s Town , and playing at pitch-and-toss , ball , marbles , and what not , with the boys of the town , amongst whom my son Jason was a great favourite with him . As for me , he was ever my white-headed boy : often ’ s the time , when I would call in at his father ’ s , where I was always made welcome , he would slip down to me in the kitchen , and ,	1800
, being caught red-handed , at the age of four or thereabouts , with his hands in a box of sugar-plums , had immediately confessed the awful fact that he had been about to eat them , and he was brought then and there before his Aunt Maria for sentence . She at once decided that he had behaved Nobly in speaking the truth , and that he must be rewarded in kind for his praiseworthy conduct , and be allowed to keep the sugar-plums ! This little story after half a century certainly gives one pleasure still to recall , and proves , I think , that cakes may be enjoyed long after they have been eaten , and also that there is a great deal to be said for justice with lollipops in the scale . But what	1800
freeholders were knocked off ; having never a freehold that they could safely swear to , and Sir Condy was not willing to have any man perjure himself for his sake , as was done on the other side , God knows ; but no matter for that . Some of our friends were dumbfounded by the lawyers asking them : Had they ever been upon the ground where their freeholds lay ? Now , Sir Condy being tender of the consciences of them that had not been on the ground , and so could not swear to a freehold when cross-examined by them lawyers , sent out for a couple of cleavesful of the sods of his farm of Gulteeshinnagh ; { 14 } and as soon as the sods came into town , he set each	1800

She gave no vails to the servants at Castle Rackrent at parting , notwithstanding the old proverb of ‘ as rich as a Jew , ’ which she , being a Jewish , they built upon with reason . But from first to last she brought nothing but misfortunes amongst us ; and if it had not been all along with her , his honour , Sir Kit , would have been now alive in all appearance . Her	1800
down from memory and hearsay of the family , there ’ s nothing but truth in it from beginning to end . That you may depend upon , for where ’ s the use of telling lies about the things which everybody knows as well as I do ? The Editor could have readily made the catastrophe of Sir Condy ’ s history more dramatic and more pathetic , if he thought it allowable to varnish the plain round tale of faithful Thady . He lays it before the English reader as a specimen of manners and characters which are perhaps unknown in England . Indeed , the domestic habits of no nation in Europe were less known to the English than those of their sister country , till within these few years . Mr. Young ’ s picture of Ireland	1800

Children were bullied and tortured with the kindest intentions ; even Maria Edgeworth at her fashionable school was stretched in a sort of machine to make her grow ; Mr. Day , as we know , to please the lady of his affections , passed eight hours a day in the stocks in order to turn out his knock-knees . One feels that a generation of ladies and gentlemen who submitted to such inflictions surely belonged to a race of heroes and heroines , and that , if the times were difficult and trying , the people also were stronger to endure them , and must have been much better fitted with nerves than we are . Miss Edgeworth ’ s life has been so often told	1800
me as I was looking at his horse ’ s heels , in hopes of a word from him . ‘ And is that old Thady ? ’ says he , as he got into his gig : I loved him from that day to this , his voice was so like the family ; and he threw me a guinea out of his waistcoat-pocket , as he drew up the reins with the other hand , his horse rearing too ; I thought I never set my eyes on a finer figure of a man , quite another sort from Sir Murtagh	1800
often heard that she was plain that to see this fashionable and agreeable figure was a pleasant surprise . Miss Edgeworth seems to be about four-and-twenty in the sketch ; she was born in ; she must have been eleven in , when Mr. Edgeworth finally came over to Ireland to settle on his own estate , and among his own people . He had been obliged some years before to leave Edgeworthstown on account of Mrs. Honora Edgeworth ’ s health ; he now returned in patriarchal fashion with Mrs. Elizabeth Edgeworth , his third wife , with his children by his first , second , and third marriages , and with two	1800
, so to speak , of Maria Edgeworth ’ s long life . Several histories of Miss Edgeworth have been lately published in England . Miss Zimmern and Miss Oliver in America have each written , and the present writer has written , and various memoirs and letters have appeared in different magazines and papers with allusions and descriptions all more or less interesting . One can but admire the spirit which animated that whole existence ; the cheerful , kindly , multiplied interest Maria Edgeworth took in the world outside , as well as in the wellbeing of all those around her . Generations , changes , new families , new experiences , none of these overwhelmed her . She seemed to move in a crowd , a cheerful , orderly crowd , keeping in tune and heart with its thousand claims ;	1800
it till they can foot it no longer , and till the sleepy notes expire under the slurring hand of the musician , retire to a bedchamber , call the favourite maid , who alone is admitted , bid her PUT DOWN THE KETTLE , lock the door , and amidst as much giggling and scrambling as possible , they get round a tea-table , on which all manner of things are huddled together . Then begin mutual railleries and mutual confidences amongst the young ladies , and the faint scream and the loud laugh is heard , and the romping for letters and pocket-books begins , and gentlemen are called by their surnames , or by the general name of fellows ! pleasant fellows ! charming fellows ! odious fellows ! abominable fellows ! and then all prudish decorums are forgotten , and then	1800
s lawsuits , they were kept in such good order , they never thought of coming near Castle Rackrent without a present of something or other -- nothing too much or too little for my lady -- eggs , honey , butter , meal , fish , game , grouse , and herrings , fresh or salt , all went for something . As for their young pigs , we had them , and the best bacon and hams they could make up , with all young chickens in spring ; but they were a set of poor wretches , and we had nothing but misfortunes with them , always breaking and running away . This , Sir Murtagh and my lady said , was	1800
the chimney began telling him how he was beloved and regretted in the county , and it did him a deal of good to hear it . ‘ Your honour has a great many friends yet that you don ’ t know of , rich and poor , in the county , ’ says I ; ‘ for as I was coming along the road I met two gentlemen in their own carriages , who asked after you , knowing me , and wanted to know where you was and all about you , and even how old I was . Think of that. ’	1800
was well satisfied . About this time we learnt from the agent , as a great secret , how the money went so fast , and the reason of the thick coming of the master ’ s drafts : he was a little too fond of play ; and Bath , they say , was no place for no young man of his fortune , where there were so many of his own countrymen , too , hunting him up and down , day and night , who had nothing to lose . At last , at Christmas , the agent wrote over to stop the drafts , for he could raise no more money on bond or mortgage	1800
that , considering all they went through , his daughter ’ s stories survived to tell their tale , and to tell it so well , with directness and conviction , that best of salt in any literary work . A letter Maria wrote to her cousin will be remembered . ‘ I beg , dear Sophy , ’ she says , ‘ that you will not call my stories by the sublime name of my works ; I shall else be ashamed when the little mouse comes forth. ’ Maria ’ s correspondence is delightful , and conveys us right	1800
the buttercups , by the varied shadows of those beautiful trees under which the cows gently tread the grass . English does not seem exactly the language in which to write of Ireland , with its sylvan wonders of natural beauty . Madame de Sevigne ’ s descriptions of her woods came to my mind . It is not a place which delights one by its actual sensual beauty , as Italy does ; it is not as in England , where a thousand associations link one to every scene and aspect -- Ireland seems to me to contain some unique and most impersonal charm , which is quite unwritable . All that evening we sat talking with our hosts round the fire ( for it was cold enough for	1800

perfect accuracy , from their actions or their appearance in public ; it is from their careless conversations , their half-finished sentences , that we may hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real characters . The life of a great or of a little man written by himself , the familiar letters , the diary of any individual published by his friends or by his enemies , after his decease , are esteemed important literary curiosities . We are surely justified , in this eager desire , to collect the most minute facts relative to the domestic lives , not only of the great and good , but even of the worthless and insignificant , since it is only by a comparison of their actual happiness or misery in the privacy of domestic life that we can	1800

your honour , we ’ ll begin and dig the potatoes , ’ etc . All the intermediate days , between the making of such speeches and the ensuing Monday , are wasted : and when Monday morning comes , it is ten to one that the business is deferred to THE NEXT Monday morning . The Editor knew a gentleman , who , to counteract this prejudice , made his workmen and labourers begin all new pieces of work upon a Saturday . [ 2 ] LET ALONE THE THREE KINGDOMS ITSELF. -- LET ALONE , in this sentence , means put out of consideration . The phrase , let	1800
quite bare , and my young master , the moment ever he set foot in it out of his gig , thought all those things must come of themselves , I believe , for he never looked after anything at all , but harum-scarum called for everything as if we were conjurors , or he in a public-house . For my part , I could not bestir myself anyhow ; I had been so much used to my late master and mistress , all was upside down with me , and the new servants in the servants ’ hall were quite out of my way ; I had nobody to talk to , and	1800
of otherwise , and he never went the circuit but twice , and then made no figure for want of a fee , and being unable to speak in public . He received his education chiefly in the college of Dublin , but before he came to years of discretion lived in the country , in a small but slated house within view of the end of the avenue . I remember him , bare footed and headed , running through the street of O ’ Shaughlin ’ s Town , and playing at pitch-and-toss , ball , marbles , and what not , with the boys of the town	1800
while afterwards , was at a terrible nonplus ; for he had no liking , not he , to stage-plays , nor to Miss Isabella either -- to his mind , as it came out over a bowl of whisky-punch at home , his little Judy M ’ Quirk , who was daughter to a sister ’ s son of mine , was worth twenty of Miss Isabella . He had seen her often when he stopped at her father ’ s cabin to drink whisky out of the eggshell , out hunting , before he came to the estate , and , as she gave out , was under something like a promise of marriage to her . Anyhow , I could not but pity my poor master , who was so bothered between them , and he an easy-hearted man , that could not disoblige nobody	1800
. Besides , there is much uncertainty even in the best authenticated ancient or modern histories ; and that love of truth , which in some minds is innate and immutable , necessarily leads to a love of secret memoirs and private anecdotes . We can not judge either of the feelings or of the characters of men with perfect accuracy , from their actions or their appearance in public ; it is from their careless conversations , their half-finished sentences , that we may hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real characters . The life of a great or of a little man written by himself , the	1800
the father of Attorney Quirk ; he is a high gentleman , and never minds what poor Thady says , and having better than fifteen hundred a year , landed estate , looks down upon honest Thady ; but I wash my hands of his doings , and as I have lived so will I die , true and loyal to the family . The family of the Rackrents is , I am proud to say , one of the most ancient in the kingdom . Everybody knows this is not the old family name , which was O ’ Shaughlin , related to the kings of Ireland -- but that was before my time . My grandfather was driver to the great Sir Patrick O ’ Shaughlin , and I heard him , when I was a boy , telling	1800
and songs have been discontinued . ‘ It ’ s a fine morning , honest Thady , ’ says she ; ‘ good-bye to ye. ’ And into the carriage she stepped , without a word more , good or bad , or even half-a-crown ; but I made my bow , and stood to see her safe out of sight for the sake of the family . Then we were all bustle in the house , which made me keep out of the way , for I walk slow and hate a bustle ; but the house was all hurry-skurry , preparing for my new master . Sir Murtagh , I forgot to notice , had no childer ; { 6 } so the Rackrent estate	1800
those times . The reign of sugar-plums had scarcely begun . It was not , as now , only ignorance and fanaticism that encouraged the giving of pain , it was the universal custom . People were still hanged for stealing , women were still burnt -- so we have been assured -- in St. Stephen ’ s Green ; though , it is true , they were considerately strangled first . Children were bullied and tortured with the kindest intentions ; even Maria Edgeworth at her fashionable school was stretched in a sort of machine to make her grow ; Mr. Day , as we know , to please the lady of	1800
Condy , are characters which could no more be met with at present in Ireland , than Squire Western or Parson Trulliber in England . There is a time when individuals can bear to be rallied for their past follies and absurdities , after they have acquired new habits and a new consciousness . Nations , as well as individuals , gradually lose attachment to their identity , and the present generation is amused , rather than offended , by the ridicule that is thrown upon its ancestors . Probably we shall soon have it in our power , in a hundred instances , to verify the truth of	1800
me , that I may have a clear view of the balance , which is all I need be talking about , you know ? ’ ‘ Very true , Sir Condy ; nobody understands business better than yourself , ’ says Jason . ‘ So I ’ ve a right to do , being born and bred to the bar , ’ says Sir Condy . ‘ Thady , do step out and see are they bringing in the things for the punch , for we ’ ve just done all we have to do for this evening. ’ I goes out accordingly , and when I came back Jason was pointing to the balance , which was a terrible sight to my poor master . ‘ Pooh ! pooh ! pooh ! ’ says he . ‘ Here ’ s so many noughts they dazzle	1800
widow ; he goes round to every person present , and each contributes sixpence or a shilling , or what they please . The reader will find in the note upon the word WAKE , more particulars respecting the conclusion of the Irish funerals . Certain old women , who cry particularly loud and well are in great request , and , as a man said to the Editor , ‘ Every one would wish and be proud to have such at his funeral , or at that of his friends. ’ The lower Irish are wonderfully eager to attend the funerals of their friends and relations , and they make their relationships branch out to a great extent . The proof that a poor man has been well beloved during his life is his having a crowded funeral	1800
married for money , and not for love. ’ ‘ That is the last thing I should ever have thought of saying of you , Sir Condy , ’ said my lady , looking very gracious . ‘ Then , my dear , ’ said Sir Condy , ‘ we shall part as good friends as we met ; so all ’ s right. ’ I was greatly rejoiced to hear this , and went out of the parlour to report it all to the kitchen . The next morning my lady and Mrs. Jane set out for Mount Juliet ’ s Town in the jaunting-car . Many wondered at my lady ’ s choosing to go away , considering all things , upon the jaunting-car , as if it was only a party of pleasure ; but they did not know till I told them that the coach was	1800
’ says she , ‘ but the old story over again ; my friends all reproaching me still for what I can ’ t help now. ’ ‘ Is it for marrying me ? ’ said my master , still shaving . ‘ What signifies , as you say , talking of that , when it can ’ t be help ’ d now ? ’ With that she heaved a great sigh that I heard plain enough in the passage . ‘ And did not you use me basely , Sir Condy , ’ says she , ‘ not to tell me you were ruined	1800
dear , ’ said my master , and bit his lip . Where have you lived , my lady , all your life , not to know a turf-stack when you see it ? thought I ; but I said nothing . Then by and by she takes out her glass , and begins spying over the country . ‘ And what ’ s all that black swamp out yonder , Sir Kit ? ’ says she . ‘ My bog , my dear , ’ says he , and went on whistling . ‘ It ’ s a very ugly prospect , my dear , ’ says she . ‘ You don ’ t see it , my dear , ’ says he , ‘ for we ’ ve planted it out	1800
over , there comes shoals of people from all parts , claiming to have obliged my master with their votes , and putting him in mind of promises which he could never remember himself to have made : one was to have a freehold for each of his four sons ; another was to have a renewal of a lease ; another an abatement ; one came to be paid ten guineas for a pair of silver buckles sold my master on the hustings , which turned out to be no better than copper gilt ; another had a long bill for oats , the half	1800
, while I was getting of the pen and ink-horn , and the sheet of paper , I ransacked my brains to think what could be the papers my poor master could have to execute in such a hurry , he that never thought of such a thing as doing business afore breakfast in the whole course of his life , for any man living ; but this was for my lady , as I afterwards found , and the more genteel of him after all her treatment . I was just witnessing the paper that he had scrawled over , and was shaking the ink out of my pen upon the carpet , when my lady came in to breakfast , and she started as if it had been a ghost ;	1800
, and his fourth , whilst his first was still alive , to his mortification and theirs . Upon this , as upon all former occasions , he had the voice of the country with him , on account of the great spirit and propriety he acted with . He met and shot the first lady ’ s brother : the next day he called out the second , who had a wooden leg , and their place of meeting by appointment being in a new-ploughed field , the wooden-leg man stuck fast in it . Sir Kit , seeing his	1800
that old clock-case which Maria wound up when she was over eighty years old . To the right and to the left along the passages were rooms opening from one into another . I could imagine Sir Walter ’ s kind eyes looking upon the scene , and Wordsworth coming down the stairs , and their friendly entertainer making all happy , and all welcome in turn ; and their hostess , the widowed Mrs. Edgeworth , responding and sympathising with each . We saw the corner by the fire where Maria wrote ; we saw her table with its pretty curves standing in its place in the deep casements . Miss Edgeworth ’ s own room is a tiny little room above looking out	1800
your honour ’ s talking on. ’ ‘ And what is a barrack-room , pray , my dear ? ’ were the first words I ever heard out of my lady ’ s lips . ‘ No matter , my dear , ’ said he , and went on talking to me , ashamed-like I should witness her ignorance . To be sure , to hear her talk one might have taken her for an innocent , [ 21 ] for it was , ‘ What ’ s this , Sir Kit ? and what ’ s that , Sir Kit ? ’ all the way	1800
to speak to you . His honour , ’ says I , raising my voice , at which his honour wakens of his own accord , and calls to me from the room to know who it was I was speaking to . Jason made no more ceremony , but follows me into the room . ‘ How are you , Sir Condy ? ’ says he ; ‘ I ’ m happy to see you looking so well ; I came up to know how you did to-day , and to see did you want for anything at the Lodge ? ’ ‘ Nothing at all , Mr. Jason , I thank you , ’ says he ; for his honour had his own share of pride , and did not choose , after all that had passed , to be beholden , I suppose	1800
tenantry . He also made himself acquainted with the different value of land on his estate . In every case where the tenant had improved the land his claim to preference over every new proposer was admitted . The mere plea , ‘ I have been on your Honour ’ s estate so many years , ’ was disregarded . ‘ Nor was it advantageous that each son , ’ says Miss Edgeworth , ‘ of the original tenant should live on his subdivided little potato garden without further exertion of mind or body. ’ Further on she continues : ‘ Not being in want of ready money , my father was not obliged to let his land to the highest bidder . He could afford to have good tenants. ’	1800
favour of her separate possessions ; but there she was too tough for him . He used to swear at her behind her back after kneeling to her face , and call her in the presence of his gentleman his stiff-necked Israelite , though before he married her that same gentleman told me he used to call her ( how he could bring it out , I don ’ t know ) ‘ my pretty Jessica ! ’ To be sure it must have been hard for her to guess what sort of a husband he reckoned to make her . When she was lying , to all expectation , on her death-bed of a broken heart , I could not but pity her , though she was a Jewish , and considering too it was no fault of hers to be taken with my master	1800
of secret memoirs and private anecdotes . We can not judge either of the feelings or of the characters of men with perfect accuracy , from their actions or their appearance in public ; it is from their careless conversations , their half-finished sentences , that we may hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real characters . The life of a great or of a little man written by himself , the familiar letters , the diary of any individual published by his friends or by his enemies , after his decease , are esteemed important literary curiosities . We are surely justified , in this eager desire , to collect the most minute facts relative to the domestic lives , not only of the great and good , but even of the	1800

Anyhow , I could not but pity my poor master , who was so bothered between them , and he an easy-hearted man , that could not disoblige nobody -- God bless him ! To be sure , it was not his place to behave ungenerous to Miss Isabella , who had disobliged all her relations for his sake , as he remarked ; and then she was locked up in her chamber , and forbid to think of him any more , which raised his spirit ,	1800

The Editor has known a gossoon to go on foot , without shoes or stockings , fifty-one English miles between sunrise and sunset . ‘ Which tree , please your honour ? ’ I made bold to say . ‘ Any tree at all that ’ s good to burn , ’ said Sir Condy ; ‘ send off smart and get one down , and the fires lighted , before my lady gets up to breakfast , or the house will be too hot to hold us. ’ He was always very considerate in all things about my lady , and she wanted for nothing whilst he had it to give	1800

HOPE TO EMULATE THE RICH HUMOUR , THE PATHETIC TENDERNESS , AND ADMIRABLE TRUTH WHICH PERVADE THE WORKS OF MY ACCOMPLISHED FRIEND , ’ Sir Walter wrote , I FELT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE ATTEMPTED FOR MY OWN COUNTRY OF THE SAME KIND AS THAT WHICH MISS EDGEWORTH SO FORTUNATELY ACHIEVED FOR IRELAND. ’ In the MEMOIRS of Miss Edgeworth there is a pretty account of her sudden burst of feeling when this passage so unexpected , and so deeply felt by her , was read out by one of her sisters , at a time when Maria lay weak and recovering from illness in	1800
that we had reached an enchanted forest amid this green sweet tangle of ivy , of flowering summer trees , of immemorial oaks and sycamores . A squirrel was darting up the branches of a beautiful spreading beech-tree , a whole army of rabbits were flashing with silver tails into the brushwood ; swallows , blackbirds , peacock-butterflies , dragonflies on the wing , a mighty sylvan life was roaming in this lovely orderly wilderness . The great Irish kitchen garden , belonging to the house , with its seven miles of wall , was also not unlike a part of a fairy tale . Its owner , Mr. Lefroy , told me that Miss Edgeworth had been constantly there . She was a great friend of Judge Lefroy . As a boy he remembered her driving	1800
principle to call upon him and his horse ; so he taught ‘ em all , as he said , to know the law of landlord and tenant . As for law , I believe no man , dead or alive , ever loved it so well as Sir Murtagh . He had once sixteen suits pending at a time , and I never saw him so much himself : roads , lanes , bogs , wells , ponds , eel-wires , orchards , trees , tithes , vagrants , gravelpits , sandpits , dunghills , and nuisances , everything upon the face of the earth furnished him good matter for a suit . He used to boast	1800
, they must settle it amongst them who was to be his second , and his third , and his fourth , whilst his first was still alive , to his mortification and theirs . Upon this , as upon all former occasions , he had the voice of the country with him , on account of the great spirit and propriety he acted with . He met and shot the first lady ’ s brother : the next day he called out the second , who had a wooden leg , and their place of meeting by appointment being in a new-ploughed field , the wooden-leg man stuck	1800
, but they are peculiarly quick and tenacious in claiming these rights . ‘ Last year your honour gave me some straw for the roof of my house and I EXPECT your honour will be after doing the same this year. ’ In this manner gifts are frequently turned into tributes . The high and low are not always dissimilar in their habits . It is said , that the Sublime Ottoman Port is very apt to claim gifts as tributes : thus it is dangerous to send the Grand Seignor a fine horse on his birthday one year , lest on his next birthday he should expect a similar present , and should	1800

be three times a week at the least with his new friends , which grieved me , who knew , by the captain ’ s groom and gentleman , how they talked of him at Mount Juliet ’ s Town , making him quite , as one may say , a laughing-stock and a butt for the whole company ; but they were soon cured of that by an accident that surprised ‘ em not a little , as it did me . There was a bit of a scrawl found upon the waiting-maid of old Mr. Moneygawl ’ s youngest daughter , Miss Isabella , that laid open the whole ; and her father , they say , was like one out of his right mind , and swore it was the last thing he	1800
he received a ball in a vital part , and was brought home , in little better than an hour after the affair , speechless on a hand-barrow to my lady . We got the key out of his pocket the first thing we did , and my son Jason ran to unlock the barrack-room , where my lady had been shut up for seven years , to acquaint her with the fatal accident . The surprise bereaved her of her senses at first , nor would she believe but we were putting some new trick upon her , to entrap her out of her jewels , for a great while , till Jason bethought himself of taking her to the window , and showed her the men bringing Sir Kit up the avenue upon the	1800

-- It was customary amongst those of Thady ’ s rank in Ireland , whenever they could get a little money , to send their sons abroad to St. Omer ’ s , or to Spain , to be educated as priests . Now they are educated at Maynooth . The Editor has lately known a young lad , who began by being a post-boy , afterwards turn into a carpenter , then quit his plane and work-bench to study his HUMANITIES , as he said , at the college of Maynooth ; but after he had gone through his course of Humanities , he determined to be a soldier instead of a priest .

to one or t ’ other , but seeing she was a stranger in a foreign country , I thought it but right to speak cheerful to her ; so I went back again to the bonfires . ‘ My lady , ’ says I , as she crossed the hall , ‘ there would have been fifty times as many ; but for fear of the horses , and frightening your ladyship , Jason and I forbid them , please your honour. ’ With that she looked at me a little bewildered . ‘ Will I have a fire lighted in the state-room to-night ? ’ was the next question	1800
, orderly crowd , keeping in tune and heart with its thousand claims ; with strength and calmness of mind to bear multiplied sorrows and a variety of care with courage , and an ever-reviving gift of spirited interest . Her history is almost unique in its curious relationships ; its changes of step-mothers , its warm family ties , its grasp of certain facts which belong to all time rather than to the hour itself . Miss Edgeworth lived for over eighty years , busy , beneficent , modest , and intelligent to the last . When she died she was mourned as unmarried women	1800

There was the PIRATE in its original volumes , and Mackintosh ’ s MEMOIRS , and Mrs. Barbauld ’ s ESSAYS , and Descartes ’ s ESSAYS , that Arthur Hallam liked to read ; Hallam ’ s CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY , and Rogers ’ s POEMS , were there all inscribed and dedicated .

Our host took us that day , among other pleasant things , for a marvellous and delightful flight on a jaunting car , to see something of the country . We sped through storms and sunshine , by open moors and fields , and then by villages and little churches , by farms where the pigs were standing at the doors to be fed , by pretty trim cottages . The lights came and went ; as the mist lifted we could see the exquisite colours , the green , the dazzling sweet lights on the meadows , playing upon the meadow-sweet and elder bushes ; at last we came to the lovely glades of Carriglass .	1800

These circumstances may appear strange to an English reader ; but there is no danger in the present times that any individual should exercise such tyranny as Colonel M ’ Guire ’ s with impunity , the power being now all in the hands of Government , and there being no possibility of obtaining from Parliament an Act of indemnity for any cruelties . Then his honour had a great deal of	1800
spirit which animated that whole existence ; the cheerful , kindly , multiplied interest Maria Edgeworth took in the world outside , as well as in the wellbeing of all those around her . Generations , changes , new families , new experiences , none of these overwhelmed her . She seemed to move in a crowd , a cheerful , orderly crowd , keeping in tune and heart with its thousand claims ; with strength and calmness of mind to bear multiplied sorrows and a variety of care with courage , and an ever-reviving gift of spirited interest . Her history is	1800
and all that he said about poor Judy I can never forget , but scorn to repeat . He did not say an unkind word of my lady , but wondered , as well he might , her relations would do nothing for him or her , and they in all this great distress . He did not take anything long to heart , let it be as it would , and had no more malice or thought of the like in him than a child that can ’ t speak ; this night it was all out of his head before	1800
see what he would go on to next ; ‘ your honour ’ s joking , to be sure ; there ’ s no compare between our poor Judy and Miss Isabella , who has a great fortune , they say. ’ { 9 } Boo ! Boo ! -- an exclamation equivalent to PSHAW or NONSENSE ‘ I ’ m not a man to mind a fortune , nor never was , ’ said Sir Condy , proudly , ‘ whatever her friends may say ; and to make short of it , ’ says he , ‘ I ’ m come to a determination upon the spot. ’ With that he swore such a terrible oath as made me cross myself . ‘ And by this book ,	1800
as she and my shister fancied , but the ungratitude of the whole from Judy might not plase him ; and he could never stand the notion of not being well spoken of or beloved like behind his back . Fortunately for all parties concerned , he was so much elevated at this time , there was no danger of his understanding anything , even if it had reached his ears . There was a great horn at the Lodge , ever since my master and Captain Moneygawl was in together , that used to belong originally to the celebrated Sir Patrick , his ancestor ; and his honour was fond often of telling the story that he learned	1800

So , my Dear , have done upon this Subject . Was Captain _Macheath_ here this Morning , for the Bank-Notes he left with you last Week ? _Mrs . Peachum_ . Yes , my Dear ; and though the Bank hath stopt Payment , he was so chearful and so agreeable ! Sure there	1720

And when the Trial is over , bring me a particular Account of his Behaviour , and of every thing that happen ’ d—You ’ ll find me here with Miss _Lucy_ . [ _Exit_ Filch . ] But why is all this Musick ? _Lucy_ . The Prisoners , whose Trials are put off ’ till next Session , are diverting themselves . _Polly_ . Sure there is nothing so charming as Music ! I ’ m fond of it to Distraction ! —But alas ! —now , all Mirth seems an Insult upon my Affliction.—Let us retire , my dear _Lucy_ , and indulge our Sorrows.—The noisy Crew , you see , are coming upon us	1720
as well as if they had been born and bred in the Place all their Lives . Why must all your Suspicion light upon me ? _Lockit_ . _Lucy_ , _Lucy_ , I will have none of these shuffling Answers . _Lucy_ . Well then—If I know any thing of him I wish I may be burnt ! _Lockit_ . Keep your Temper , _Lucy_ , or I shall pronounce you guilty . _Lucy_ . Keep yours , Sir , —I do wish I may be burnt . I do—And what can I say more to convince you ? _Lockit_ . Did he tip handsomly ? —How much did he come down with ? Come , Hussy , don ’ t	1720
a Husband in these Circumstances ? _Lucy_ . A Husband ! _Macheath_ . In ev ’ ry Respect but the Form , and that , my Dear , may be said over us at any time.—Friends should not insist upon Ceremonies .

_Macheath_ . Those , Mr. _Lockit_ , seem to be the heaviest of the whole Set . With your Leave , I should like the further Pair better . _Lockit_ . Look ye , Captain , we know what is fittest for our Prisoners . When a Gentleman uses me with Civility , I always do the best I can to please him.—Hand them down I say.—We have them of all Prices , from one Guinea to ten , and ’ tis fitting every Gentleman should please himself . _Macheath_ . I understand you , Sir . [ _Gives Money_ . ] The Fees	1720

Therefore , I beg you , Gentlemen , look well to yourselves , for in all probability you may live some Months longer . _Matt_ . We are heartily sorry , Captain , for your Misfortune.—But ’ tis what we must all come to . _Macheath_ . _Peachum_ and _Lockit_ , you know , are infamous Scoundrels . Their Lives are as much in your Power , as yours are in theirs.—Remember your dying Friend ! — ’ Tis my last Request.—Bring those Villains to the Gallows before you , and I am satisfied . _Matt_ .

The Fellow with a brown Coat with a narrow Gold Binding , I am told , is never without Money . _Macheath_ .

But you know , Sir , you sent him as far as _Hockley in the Hole_ for three of the Ladies , for one in _Vinegar-Yard_ , and for the rest of them somewhere about _Lewkner ’ s-Lane_ .

Say ! ’ — ‘ They are both gone up to the church to pray . ‘ Because I was happy upon the heath , And smiled among the winter ’ s snow , They clothed me in the clothes of death , And taught me to sing the notes of woe . ‘ And because I am happy and dance and sing , They think they have done me no injury , And are gone to praise God and His priest and king , Who made up a heaven of our misery. ’ NURSE ’ S SONG When	1780

And not sit both night and day , Wiping all our tears away ? O no ! never can it be ! Never , never can it be !

a translation . And in addition to the fifteen thousand lines of the 'Iliad ' , he had engaged to furnish an introduction and notes . At first the magnitude of the undertaking frightened him . `` What terrible moments , '' he said to Spence , `` does one feel after one has engaged for a large work . In the beginning of my translating the 'Iliad ' , I wished anybody would hang me a hundred times . It sat so heavily on my mind at first that I often used to dream of it and do sometimes still . '' In spite of his discouragement , however , and of the ill health which so	1710
with him , disliked his political connections and probably despised his verses , and in the 'Imitation ' already mentioned had alluded to him under the title of Lord Fanny as capable of turning out a thousand lines of verse a day . This was sufficient cause , if cause were needed , to induce Hervey to join Lady Mary in her warfare against Pope . The first blow was struck in an anonymous poem , probably the combined work of the two allies , called 'Verses addressed to the Imitator of Horace ' , which appeared in March , , and it was followed up in August by an 'Epistle from a Nobleman	1710

In human works , tho ' labour 'd on	1710
; and he himself a wretched outcast : with the emblem of [ his ] crooked mind Marked on [ his ] back like Cain by God 's own hand . And to cap the climax , as soon as these shameful libels were in print , Lord Hervey bustled off to show them to the Queen and to laugh with her over the fine way in which he had put down the bitter little poet . In order to understand and appreciate Pope 's reception of these attacks , we must recall to ourselves the position in which he lived . He was a Catholic , and I have already ( Introduction , p. x ) called attention to the precarious , tenure by which the	1710
fellow , half-fuddled , who offered to jump in , and swore though he liked not the liquor , he would have the Toast . He was opposed in his resolution ; yet this whim gave foundation to the present honor which is done to the lady we mention in our liquors , who has ever since been called a TOAST . '' To understand the point of the story one must know that it was an old custom to put a bit of toast in hot drinks . In this line in the poem Thalestris insinuates that if Belinda submits tamely to the rape of the lock , her position as a toast will be forfeited . '113-116 ' Thalestris supposes that the baron will have the lock set in a ring under a bit of crystal . Old-fashioned hair-rings	1710
of its frank admission of the great man 's merits . And it must also be said that Pope has hit off some of the faults of Addison 's character , -- his coldness , his self-complacency , his quiet sneer , his indulgence of flattering fools -- in a way that none of his biographers have done . That Pope was not blind to Addison 's chief merit as an author is fully shown by a passage in a later poem , less well known than the portrait of Atticus , but well worth quotation . After speaking of the licentiousness of literature in Restoration days , he goes on to say : In our own ( excuse some courtly stains ) No whiter page than Addison 's remains , He from the	1710
than twice its length . It would be an interesting task for the student to compare the two forms printed in this edition , to note exactly what has been added , and the reasons for its addition , and to mark how Pope has smoothed the junctures and blended the old and the new . Nothing that he could do would admit him more intimately to the secrets of Pope 's mastery of his art . A word must be said in closing as to the merits of 'The Rape of the Lock ' and its position in English literature . In the first place it is an inimitable picture of one phase , at least , of the life of the time ,	1710
with pain , In ev'ry place is sought , but sought in vain : 155 With such a prize no mortal must be blessed , So heav'n decrees ! with heav'n who can contest ?

There broken vows , and death-bed alms are found , And lovers ' hearts with ends of ribbon bound , The courtier 's promises , and sick man 's pray'rs , The smiles of harlots , and the tears of	1710

Pope himself shines through every line . Johnson advised authors who wished to attain a perfect style to give their days and nights to a study of Addison . With equal justice one might advise students who wish to catch the spirit of our so-called Augustan age , and to realize at once the limitations and possibilities of its poetry , to devote themselves to the study of 'The Rape of the Lock ' . DEDICATION 'Mrs . Arabella ' : the title of Mrs. was still given in Pope 's time to unmarried ladies as soon as they were old enough to enter society .

which a true critic should possess , good taste , learning , modesty , frankness , and tact , and concludes with a brief sketch of the history of criticism from Aristotle to Walsh . This is the general outline of the poem , sufficient , I think , to show that it is not a mere bundle of poetic formulae . But within these broad limits the thought of the poem wanders freely , and is quite rambling , inconsistent , and illogical enough to show that Pope is not formulating an exact and definitely determined system of thought . Such indeed was , I fancy , hardly his purpose . It was rather to give clear , vivid , and convincing expression to certain ideas which were at that time generally accepted as orthodox in the realm of literary criticism . No better expression of these	1710

man , '' and it may therefore be regarded as an attempt to confute the skeptics who argued from the existence of evil in the world and the wretchedness of man 's existence to the impossibility of belief in an all-good and all-wise God . It attempts to do this , not by an appeal to revelation or the doctrines of Christianity , but simply on the basis of a common-sense interpretation of the facts of existence . A brief outline of the poem will show the general tenor of Pope 's argument . The first epistle deals with the nature and state	1710

'' In other words , the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot ' which we see that Pope was working over at the date of this letter , August 25 , , was , in the old-fashioned phrase , his 'Apologia ' , his defense of his life and work . As usual , Pope 's account of his work can not be taken literally . A comparison of dates	1710

quiet charm of country life which he had come to feel in his boyhood at Binfield , and for which he early withdrew from the whirl and dissipations of London to the groves and the grotto of his villa at Twickenham . * * * * * NOTES ON THE DESCENT OF DULLNESS In the fourth book of the 'Dunciad ' , Pope abandons the satire on the pretenders to literary fame which had run through the earlier books , and flies at higher game . He represents the Goddess Dullness as `` coming in her majesty to destroy Order and Science , and to substitute the Kingdom of the Dull upon earth . '' He attacks the pedantry and formalism of university education in his day , the	1710
mock-heroic for the purposes of satire . Now it was a dogma of the critical creed of the day , which Pope devoutly accepted , that every epic must have a well-recognized `` machinery . '' Machinery , as he kindly explained to Miss Fermor , was a `` term invented by the critics to signify that part which the deities , angels , or demons are made to act in a poem , '' in short for the whole supernatural element . Such machinery was quite wanting in the first draft of the Rape ; it must be supplied if the poem was to	1710

These Machines I determined to raise on a very new and odd foundation , the Rosicrucian doctrine of Spirits .

proper end and purpose of its _being_ . The science of Human Nature is , like all other sciences , reduced to a _few clear points_ : There are not _many certain truths_ in this world . It is therefore in the Anatomy of the mind as in that of the Body ; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large , open , and perceptible parts , than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels , the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation . The _disputes_ are all upon these last , and , I will venture to say , they have less sharpened the _wits_ than the _hearts_ of men against each other , and have diminished the practice , more than advanced the theory of Morality .

So far back as Ben Jonson 's time ( Eastward Ho , I , ii , 36 ) it was the mark of the unfashionable middle-class citizen to live in this quarter . A `` wit '' in Queen Anne 's day would have scorned to lodge there . '121 Sir Plume ' : this was Sir George Brown , brother of Mrs. Morley ( Thalestris ) . He was not unnaturally offended at the picture drawn of him in this poem . Pope told a friend many years later that `` nobody was angry but Sir George Brown , and he was	1710
, called 'Verses addressed to the Imitator of Horace ' , which appeared in March , , and it was followed up in August by an 'Epistle from a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity ' , which also appeared anonymously , but was well known to be the work of Lord Hervey . In these poems Pope was abused in the most unmeasured terms . His work was styled a mere collection of libels ; he had no invention except in defamation ; he was a mere pretender to genius . His morals were not left unimpeached ; he was charged with selling other men 's work printed in his name , -- a gross distortion of his employing assistants in the translation of the 'Odyssey ' ,	1710
the 'Essay on Man ' as the reasoned argument of a philosopher , we shall turn from it with something like contempt ; if we read it as the expression of a poet 's sentiments , we shall , I think , leave it with an admiration warmer than before for a character that has been so much abused and so little understood as that of Pope .

to their individual powers and did not accept with sufficient humility the orthodox rules of poetry . This dogma , by the way , is hardly touched upon in the 'Essay ' , but is elaborated with great emphasis in Pope 's later utterance on the principles of literature , the well-known 'Epistle to Augustus ' . Finally with the establishment of the reign of Reason in France under Louis XIV , and in England a little later , the full day had come , and literary sins of omission and commission that might be winked at in such an untutored	1710

Delighted with the praise of her beauty she may none the less have felt called upon to play the part of the offended lady when the poem got about and the ribald wits of the day began to read into it double meanings which reflected upon her reputation . To soothe her ruffled feelings Pope dedicated the second edition of the poem to her in a delightful letter in which he thanked her for having permitted the publication of the first edition to forestall an imperfect	1710

Tonson wrote Pope a respectful letter asking for the honor of being allowed to publish them . One may fancy the delight with which the sixteen-year-old boy received this offer . It is a proof of Pope 's patience as well as his precocity that he delayed three years before accepting it . It was not till that his first published verses , the 'Pastorals ' , a fragment translated from Homer	1710

on the evening of May 30 , so quietly that his friends hardly knew that the end had come . He was buried in Twickenham Church , near the monument he had erected to his parents , and his coffin was carried to the grave by six of the poorest men of the parish . It is plain even from so slight a sketch as this that the common conception of Pope as `` the wicked wasp of Twickenham , '' a bitter , jealous , and malignant spirit , is utterly out of accord with the facts of his life .

only fair to realize the causes of his bitterness . Pope 's education was short and irregular . He was taught the rudiments of Latin and Greek by his family priest , attended for a brief period a school in the country and another in London , and at the early age of twelve left school altogether , and settling down at his father 's house in the country began to read to his heart 's delight . He roamed through the classic poets , translating passages that pleased him , went up for a time to London to get lessons in French and Italian , and above all read with eagerness and attention the works of older English poets , -- Spenser , Waller , and Dryden . He had already , it would seem , determined to become a	1710

and the daringly irreverent speculations of freethinkers and infidels . At the close of the book he represents the Goddess as dismissing her worshipers with a speech which she concludes with `` a yawn of extraordinary virtue . '' Under its influence `` all nature nods , '' and pulpits , colleges , and Parliament succumb . The poem closes with the magnificent description of the descent of Dullness and her final conquest of art , philosophy , and religion . It is said that Pope himself admired these lines so much that he could not repeat them without his voice faltering with emotion . `` And	1710

work , not to some lord who would have rewarded him with a handsome present , but to his old acquaintance , Congreve , the last survivor of the brilliant comic dramatists of Dryden 's day . And now resting for a time from his long labors , Pope turned to the adornment and cultivation of the little house and garden that he had leased at Twickenham . Pope 's father had died in , and the poet , rejecting politely but firmly the suggestion of his friend , Atterbury , that he might now turn Protestant , devoted himself with double tenderness to the care of his aged and infirm mother . He brought her with him to Twickenham , where she lived till , dying in that year at the great age of ninety-one . It may	1710

to the 'Dunciad ' Pope collected some of the epithets with which his enemies had pelted him , `` an ape , '' `` an ass , '' `` a frog , '' `` a coward , '' `` a fool , '' `` a little abject thing . '' He affected , indeed , to despise his assailants , but there is only too good evidence that their poisoned arrows rankled in his heart . Richardson , the painter , found him one day reading the latest abusive pamphlet . `` These things are my diversion , '' said the poet , striving to put the best face	1710
time that Hervey and Lady Mary were heaping abuse upon him , as a monster devoid of all good qualities . And now having discussed the various insertions in the 'Epistle ' , let us look for a moment at the poem as a whole , and see what is the nature of Pope 's defense of himself and of his reply to his enemies . It is cast in the form of a dialogue between the poet himself and Arbuthnot . Pope begins by complaining of the misfortunes which his reputation as a successful man of letters has brought upon him . He is a mark for all the starving scribblers of the town who besiege him for advice , recommendations , and hard cash . Is it not enough to make a man write	1710
, , and to Pope 's dismay and wrath a rival translation appeared almost simultaneously . Tickell , one of Addison 's `` little senate , '' had also begun a translation of the 'Iliad ' , and although he announced in the preface that he intended to withdraw in favor of Pope and take up a translation of the 'Odyssey ' , the poet 's suspicions were at once aroused . And they were quickly fanned into a flame by the gossip of the town which reported that Addison , the recognized authority in literary criticism , pronounced Tickell 's version `` the best that ever was in any language . '' Rumor went so far , in fact , as to hint pretty broadly that Addison himself was	1710
. On her return he induced her to settle with her husband at Twickenham . Here he continued his attentions , half real , half in the affected gallantry of the day , until , to quote the lady 's own words to her daughter many years after , `` at some ill-chosen time when she least expected what romancers call a declaration , he made such passionate love to her , as , in spite of her utmost endeavours to be angry and look grave , provoked an immoderate fit of laughter , '' and , she added , from that moment Pope became her implacable enemy . Certainly by the time Pope began to write	1710
place . He relied upon his genius alone for his support , and his genius gave him all that he asked , a modest competency . His relations with his rich and powerful friends were marked by the same independent spirit . He never cringed or flattered , but met them on even terms , and raised himself by merit alone from his position as the unknown son of an humble shopkeeper to be the friend and associate of the greatest fortunes and most powerful minds in England . It is not too much to say that the career of a man of letters as	1710
direct address to the poet 's `` guide , philosopher , and friend . '' In substance the 'Essay on Man ' is a discussion of the moral order of the world . Its purpose is `` to vindicate the ways of God to man , '' and it may therefore be regarded as an attempt to confute the skeptics who argued from the existence of evil in the world and the wretchedness of man 's existence to the impossibility of belief in an all-good and all-wise God . It attempts to do this , not by an appeal to revelation or the doctrines of Christianity , but simply on the basis of a common-sense interpretation of the facts of existence .	1710

Let peals of laughter , Codrus ! round thee break , 85 Thou unconcern 'd canst hear the mighty crack : Pit , Box , and gall'ry in convulsions hurl 'd , Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world . Who shames a Scribbler ? break one cobweb thro ' , He spins the slight , self-pleasing thread anew : 90 Destroy his fib or sophistry , in vain , The creature 's at his dirty work again , Thron 'd in the centre of his thin designs , Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines !

future existence , without asking for the glories of the Christian 's heaven . '111 equal sky : ' impartial heaven , for the heaven of the Indians was open to all men , good or bad . '113-130 ' In this passage Pope blames those civilized men who , though they should be wiser than the Indian , murmur against the decrees of God . The imperative verbs `` weigh , '' `` call , '' `` say , '' etc. , are used satirically . '113 scale of sense : ' the scale , or means of judgment , which our senses give us . '117 gust : ' the pleasure of taste . '120 ' The murmurers are dissatisfied that man is not at once perfect in his present state and	1710
' mental bent , or inclination . '208 ' This line is based upon physiological theories which are now obsolete . According to these wind or air supplied the lack of blood or of animal spirits in imperfectly constituted bodies . To such bodies Pope compares those ill-regulated minds where a deficiency of learning and natural ability is supplied by self-conceit . '216 ' The Pierian spring : the spring of the Muses , who were called Pierides in Greek mythology . It is used here as a symbol for learning , particularly for the study of literature .

. It styled woman a goddess and really regarded her as little better than a doll . The passion of love had fallen from the high estate it once possessed and become the mere relaxation of the idle moments of a man of fashion . In the comedies of Congreve , for example , a lover even if honestly in love thinks it as incumbent upon him to make light of his passion before his friends as to exaggerate it in all the forms of affected compliment before his mistress . In 'The Rape of the Lock ' Pope has caught and fixed forever the atmosphere of this age . It is not	1710
Sir Isaac Newton to say after all his wonderful discoveries , `` I do not know what I may appear to the world , but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay all the time undiscovered before me . '' '244 ' peculiar parts : individual parts . '248 ev'n thine , O Rome : ' there are so many splendid churches in Rome that an inhabitant of this city would be less inclined than a stranger to wonder at the perfect proportions of any of them .

' the word `` movement '' is understood after `` single . '' '61-68 ' Pope here illustrates his preceding argument by analogy .

'69-76 ' Pope now goes on to argue that on the basis of what has been proved we ought not to regard man as an imperfect being , but rather as one who is perfectly adapted to his place in the universe . His knowledge , for example , is measured by the brief	1710

On account of some supposed satirical allusions his opera 'Polly ' was refused a license , and when his friends , the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry ( see l. 260 ) solicited subscriptions for it in the palace , they were driven from the court . Gay died in , and Pope wrote an epitaph for his tomb in Westminster Abbey . It is to this that he alludes in l. 258 .

But the sum was honestly earned by hard and wearisome work . Pope was no Greek scholar ; it is said , indeed , that he was just able to make out the sense of the original with a translation .

, is skill in ancient or in foreign tongues . He that has long cultivated another language , will find its words and combinations croud upon his memory ; and haste and negligence , refinement and affectation , will obtrude borrowed terms and exotick expressions . The great pest of speech is frequency of translation . No book was ever turned from one language into another , without imparting something of its native idiom ; this is the most mischievous and comprehensive innovation ; single words may enter by thousands , and the fabrick of the tongue continue the same , but new phraseology changes much at once ; it alters not the single stones of the building	1750
of letters is irregular ; and if they are sometimes omitted , defect in such minute observations will be more easily excused , than superfluity . In the investigation both of the orthography and signification of words , their ETYMOLOGY was necessarily to be considered , and they were therefore to be divided into primitives and derivatives . A primitive word , is that which can be traced no further to any English root ; thus circumspect , circumvent , circumstance , delude , concave and complicate , though compounds in the Latin , are to us primitives . Derivatives are all those that can be referred to any word in English of greater simplicity . The derivatives I have referred to their primitives , with an accuracy sometimes needless ; for who does not see	1750
the general fabrick of a language , to trace one word from another , by noting the usual modes of derivation and inflection ; and uniformity must be preserved in systematical works , though sometimes at the expence of particular propriety . Among other derivatives I have been careful to insert and elucidate the anomalous plurals of nouns and preterites of verbs , which in the Teutonick dialects are very frequent , and though familiar to those who have always used them , interrupt and embarrass the learners of our language . The two languages from which our primitives have been derived are the Roman and Teutonick : under the Roman I comprehend the French and provincial tongues ; and under the Teutonick range	1750
effects of anxious diligence and persevering activity . The nice and subtle ramifications of meaning were not easily avoided by a mind intent upon accuracy , and convinced of the necessity of disentangling combinations , and separating similitudes . Many of the distinctions which to common readers appear useless and idle , will be found real and important by men versed in the school philosophy , without which no dictionary shall ever be accurately compiled , or skilfully examined . Some senses however there are , which , though not the same , are yet so nearly allied , that they are often confounded . Most men think indistinctly , and therefore can not speak with exactness ; and consequently some examples might be indifferently put to either signification : this uncertainty is not to be imputed to me , who do not form , but register	1750
repeated , appears with new associates and in different combinations , and every quotation contributes something to the stability or enlargement of the language . When words are used equivocally , I receive them in either sense ; when they are metaphorical , I adopt them in their primitive acceptation . I have sometimes , though rarely , yielded to the temptation of exhibiting a genealogy of sentiments , by shewing how one authour copied the thoughts and diction of another : such quotations are indeed little more than repetitions , which might justly be censured , did they not gratify the	1750

I have sometimes , though rarely , yielded to the temptation of exhibiting a genealogy of sentiments , by shewing how one authour copied the thoughts and diction of another : such quotations are indeed little more than repetitions , which might justly be censured , did they not gratify the mind , by affording a kind of intellectual history .

When I am animated by this wish , I look with pleasure on my book , however defective , and deliver it to the world with the spirit of a man that has endeavoured well . That it will immediately become popular I have not promised to myself : a few wild blunders , and risible absurdities , from which no work of such multiplicity was ever free , may for a time furnish folly with laughter , and harden ignorance in contempt	1750
a paraphrase ; such are all those which are by the grammarians termed expletives , and , in dead languages , are suffered to pass for empty sounds , of no other use than to fill a verse , or to modulate a period , but which are easily perceived in living tongues to have power and emphasis , though it be sometimes such as no other form of expression can convey . My labour has likewise been much increased by a class of verbs too frequent in the English language , of which the signification is so loose and general , the use so vague and indeterminate , and the senses	1750
ideas , is well known to those who have joined philosophy with grammar ; and if I have not expressed them very clearly , it must be remembered that I am speaking of that which words are insufficient to explain . The original sense of words is often driven out of use by their metaphorical acceptations , yet must be inserted for the sake of a regular origination . Thus I know not whether ardour is used for material heat , or whether flagrant , in English , ever signifies the same with burning ; yet such are the primitive	1750

Among other derivatives I have been careful to insert and elucidate the anomalous plurals of nouns and preterites of verbs , which in the Teutonick dialects are very frequent , and though familiar to those who have always used them , interrupt and embarrass the learners of our language . The two languages from which our primitives have been derived are the Roman and Teutonick : under the Roman I comprehend the French and provincial tongues ; and under the Teutonick range the Saxon , German , and all their kindred dialects .

copied their books ; not that I might appropriate their labours or usurp their honours , but that I might spare a perpetual repetition by one general acknowledgment . Of these , whom I ought not to mention but with the reverence due to instructors and benefactors , Junius appears to have excelled in extent of learning , and Skinner in rectitude of understanding . Junius was accurately skilled in all the northern languages . Skinner probably examined the ancient and remoter dialects only by occasional inspection into dictionaries ; but the learning of Junius is often of no other use than to show him a track by which he may deviate from his purpose , to which Skinner always presses forward by the shortest way . Skinner is often ignorant	1750
No book was ever turned from one language into another , without imparting something of its native idiom ; this is the most mischievous and comprehensive innovation ; single words may enter by thousands , and the fabrick of the tongue continue the same , but new phraseology changes much at once ; it alters not the single stones of the building , but the order of the columns . If an academy should be established for the cultivation of our stile , which I , who can never wish to see dependance multiplied , hope the spirit of English	1750
they not gratify the mind , by affording a kind of intellectual history . The various syntactical structures occurring in the examples have been carefully noted ; the licence or negligence with which many words have been hitherto used , has made our stile capricious and indeterminate ; when the different combinations of the same word are exhibited together , the preference is readily given to propriety , and I have often endeavoured to direct the choice . Thus have I laboured by settling the orthography , displaying the analogy , regulating the structures , and ascertaining the signification of English words , to perform all the parts of a faithful lexicographer : but I have not always executed my own scheme ,	1750
have always used them , interrupt and embarrass the learners of our language . The two languages from which our primitives have been derived are the Roman and Teutonick : under the Roman I comprehend the French and provincial tongues ; and under the Teutonick range the Saxon , German , and all their kindred dialects . Most of our polysyllables are Roman , and our words of one syllable are very often Teutonick . In assigning the Roman original , it has perhaps sometimes happened that I have mentioned only the Latin , when the word was borrowed from the French , and considering myself as employed only in the illustration of my own language , I have not been very careful to observe whether the Latin word be pure	1750
dictionaries ; but the learning of Junius is often of no other use than to show him a track by which he may deviate from his purpose , to which Skinner always presses forward by the shortest way . Skinner is often ignorant , but never ridiculous : Junius is always full of knowledge ; but his variety distracts his judgment , and his learning is very frequently disgraced by his absurdities . The votaries of the northern muses will not perhaps easily restrain their indignation , when they find the name of Junius thus degraded by a disadvantageous comparison ; but whatever reverence is due to his diligence , or his attainments , it can be no criminal degree of censoriousness to charge that etymologist with want of judgment , who can seriously derive dream from drama , because life	1750
signification of English words , to perform all the parts of a faithful lexicographer : but I have not always executed my own scheme , or satisfied my own expectations . The work , whatever proofs of diligence and attention it may exhibit , is yet capable of many improvements : the orthography which I recommend is still controvertible , the etymology which I adopt is uncertain , and perhaps frequently erroneous ; the explanations are sometimes too much contracted , and sometimes too much diffused , the significations are distinguished rather with subtilty than skill , and the attention is harrassed with unnecessary minuteness . The examples are too often injudiciously truncated , and perhaps sometimes , I hope very rarely , alleged in a mistaken sense ; for in making this	1750
English , ever signifies the same with burning ; yet such are the primitive ideas of these words , which are therefore set first , though without examples , that the figurative senses may be commodiously deduced . Such is the exuberance of signification which many words have obtained , that it was scarcely possible to collect all their senses ; sometimes the meaning of derivatives must be sought in the mother term , and sometimes deficient explanations of the primitive may be supplied in the train of derivation . In any case of doubt or difficulty , it will be always proper to examine all the words of the same race ; for some words are slightly passed over to	1750
where success would have been without applause , and diligence without reward . Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries ; whom mankind have considered , not as the pupil , but the slave of science , the pionier of literature , doomed only to remove rubbish and clear obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press forward to conquest and glory , without bestowing a smile on the humble drudge that facilitates their progress . Every other authour may aspire to praise ; the lexicographer can only hope to escape reproach , and even this negative recompense has been yet granted to very few . I have , notwithstanding this discouragement , attempted a dictionary of the English language , which , while it was employed in the cultivation of every species of literature ,	1750

, and show by what gradations of intermediate sense it has passed from its primitive to its remote and accidental signification ; so that every foregoing explanation should tend to that which follows , and the series be regularly concatenated from the first notion to the last . This is specious , but not always practicable ; kindred senses may be so interwoven , that the perplexity can not be disentangled , nor any reason be assigned why one should be ranged before the other . When the radical idea branches out into parallel ramifications , how can a consecutive series be formed of senses in their nature collateral ? The shades of meaning	1750
, and perhaps sometimes , I hope very rarely , alleged in a mistaken sense ; for in making this collection I trusted more to memory , than , in a state of disquiet and embarrassment , memory can contain , and purposed to supply at the review what was left incomplete in the first transcription . Many terms appropriated to particular occupations , though necessary and significant , are undoubtedly omitted ; and of the words most studiously considered and exemplified , many senses have escaped observation . Yet these failures , however frequent , may admit extenuation and apology . To have attempted much is always	1750
by which re is prefixed to note repetition , and un to signify contrariety or privation , all the examples can not be accumulated , because the use of these particles , if not wholly arbitrary , is so little limited , that they are hourly affixed to new words as occasion requires , or is imagined to require them . There is another kind of composition more frequent in our language than perhaps in any other , from which arises to foreigners the greatest difficulty . We modify the signification of many verbs by a particle subjoined ; as to come off , to escape by a fetch ; to fall on , to	1750
followed ; and some still continue to be variously written , as authours differ in their care or skill : of these it was proper to enquire the true orthography , which I have always considered as depending on their derivation , and have therefore referred them to their original languages : thus I write enchant , enchantment , enchanter , after the French and incantation after the Latin ; thus entire is chosen rather than intire , because it passed to us not from the Latin integer , but from the French entier . Of many words it is difficult to say whether they were immediately received from the Latin or the French , since at the time when we had dominions in France ,	1750

Every other authour may aspire to praise ; the lexicographer can only hope to escape reproach , and even this negative recompense has been yet granted to very few . I have , notwithstanding this discouragement , attempted a dictionary of the English language , which , while it was employed in the cultivation of every species of literature , has itself been hitherto neglected ; suffered to spread , under the direction of chance , into wild exuberance ; resigned to the tyranny of time and fashion ; and exposed to the corruptions of ignorance , and caprices of innovation . When I took the first survey of my undertaking , I found our	1750
. The particles are among all nations applied with so great latitude , that they are not easily reducible under any regular scheme of explication : this difficulty is not less , nor perhaps greater , in English , than in other languages . I have laboured them with diligence , I hope with success ; such at least as can be expected in a task , which no man , however learned or sagacious , has yet been able to perform . Some words there are which I can not explain , because I do not understand them ; these might have been omitted very often with little inconvenience , but I would not so far indulge my vanity as to decline this confession : for	1750
he does not understand ; that a writer will sometimes be hurried by eagerness to the end , and sometimes faint with weariness under a task , which Scaliger compares to the labours of the anvil and the mine ; that what is obvious is not always known , and what is known is not always present ; that sudden fits of inadvertency will surprize vigilance , slight avocations will seduce attention , and casual eclipses of the mind will darken learning ; and that the writer shall often in vain trace his memory at the moment of need , for that which yesterday he knew with intuitive readiness , and which will come uncalled into his thoughts tomorrow . In this work , when it shall be found	1750
. If an academy should be established for the cultivation of our stile , which I , who can never wish to see dependance multiplied , hope the spirit of English liberty will hinder or destroy , let them , instead of compiling grammars and dictionaries , endeavour , with all their influence , to stop the licence of translatours , whose idleness and ignorance , if it be suffered to proceed , will reduce us to babble a dialect of France . If the changes that we fear be thus irresistible , what remains but to acquiesce with silence , as in the other insurmountable distresses of humanity ? It remains that we	1750
book but the works of lexicographers . Of such I have omitted many , because I had never read them ; and many I have inserted , because they may perhaps exist , though they have escaped my notice : they are , however , to be yet considered as resting only upon the credit of former dictionaries . Others , which I considered as useful , or know to be proper , though I could not at present support them by authorities , I have suffered to stand upon my own attestation , claiming the same privilege with my predecessors of being sometimes credited without proof . The words , thus selected and disposed , are grammatically considered ; they are referred	1750
, pronounced wrong . Short directions are sometimes given where the sound of letters is irregular ; and if they are sometimes omitted , defect in such minute observations will be more easily excused , than superfluity . In the investigation both of the orthography and signification of words , their ETYMOLOGY was necessarily to be considered , and they were therefore to be divided into primitives and derivatives .

Derivatives are all those that	1750
a task of greater difficulty : the deficiency of dictionaries was immediately apparent ; and when they were exhausted , what was yet wanting must be sought by fortuitous and unguided excursions into books , and gleaned as industry should find , or chance should offer it , in the boundless chaos of a living speech . My search , however , has been either skilful or lucky ; for I have much augmented the vocabulary . As my design was a dictionary , common or appellative , I have omitted all words which have relation to proper names ; such as Arian , Socinian ,	1750
are admitted , when they are found in authours not obsolete , or when they have any force or beauty that may deserve revival . As composition is one of the chief characteristicks of a language , I have endeavoured to make some reparation for the universal negligence of my predecessors , by inserting great numbers of compounded words , as may be found under after , fore , new , night , fair , and many more . These , numerous as they are , might be multiplied , but that use and curiosity are here satisfied , and the frame of our language and modes of our combination amply discovered . Of some forms of composition , such as that by which re is prefixed to note repetition , and un to signify contrariety or privation ,	1750

of parental fondness , it is natural to form conjectures . Those who have been persuaded to think well of my design , will require that it should fix our language , and put a stop to those alterations which time and chance have hitherto been suffered to make in it without opposition . With this consequence I will confess that I flattered myself for a while ; but now begin to fear that I have indulged expectation which neither reason nor experience can justify . When we see men grow old and die at a certain time one after another , from century to century	1750
; things may be not only too little , but too much known , to be happily illustrated . To explain , requires the use of terms less abstruse than that which is to be explained , and such terms can not always be found ; for as nothing can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known , and evident without proof , so nothing can be defined but by the use of words too plain to admit a definition . Other words there are , of which the sense is too subtle and evanescent to be fixed in a paraphrase ; such are all those which are by the grammarians termed expletives , and , in dead languages ,	1750
writer . In this part of the work , where caprice has long wantoned without controul , and vanity sought praise by petty reformation , I have endeavoured to proceed with a scholar 's reverence for antiquity , and a grammarian 's regard to the genius of our tongue . I have attempted few alterations , and among those few , perhaps the greater part is from the modern to the ancient practice ; and I hope I may be allowed to recommend to those , whose thoughts have been perhaps employed too anxiously on verbal singularities , not to disturb , upon narrow views , or for minute propriety , the orthography of their fathers . It has been asserted , that for the law to be KNOWN , is of more importance than to be RIGHT . Change , says Hooker , is not made without inconvenience	1750

words , among the terms of domestick use , which are not French ; but many French , which are very remote from Latin . Even in words of which the derivation is apparent , I have been often obliged to sacrifice uniformity to custom ; thus I write , in compliance with a numberless majority , convey and inveigh , deceit and receipt , fancy and phantom ; sometimes the derivative varies from the primitive , as explain and explanation , repeat and repetition . Some combinations of letters having the same power are used indifferently without any discoverable reason of choice , as in choak , choke ; soap , sope ; jewel , fuel , and many others ; which I have sometimes inserted twice , that those who search for them	1750
and , perhaps , without much improvement ; for I did not find by my first experiments , that that I had not of my own was easily to be obtained : I saw that one enquiry only gave occasion to another , that book referred to book , that to search was not always to find , and to find was not always to be informed ; and that thus to persue perfection , was , like the first inhabitants of Arcadia , to chace the sun , which , when they had reached the hill where he seemed to rest , was still beheld at the same distance from them . I then contracted my design	1750
, for almost a century , has , by the concurrence of many causes , been gradually departing from its original Teutonick character , and deviating towards a Gallick structure and phraseology , from which it ought to be our endeavour to recal it , by making our ancient volumes the ground-work of stile , admitting among the additions of later times , only such as may supply real deficiencies , such as are readily adopted by the genius of our tongue , and incorporate easily with our native idioms . But as every language has a time of rudeness antecedent to perfection , as well as of false refinement and declension , I have been cautious lest my zeal for antiquity might drive me into times too remote , and croud my book with words now no longer understood . I have fixed Sidney 's	1750

As my design was a dictionary , common or appellative , I have omitted all words which have relation to proper names ; such as Arian , Socinian , Calvinist , Benedictine , Mahometan ; but have retained those of a more general nature , as Heathen , Pagan . Of the terms of art I have received such as could be found either in books	1750
to show likewise my attention to things ; to pierce deep into every science , to enquire the nature of every substance of which I inserted the name , to limit every idea by a definition strictly logical , and exhibit every production of art or nature in an accurate description , that my book might be in place of all other dictionaries whether appellative or technical . But these were the dreams of a poet doomed at last to wake a lexicographer . I soon found that it is too late to look for instruments , when the work calls for execution , and that whatever abilities I had brought to my task , with	1750
as masters of elegance or models of stile ; but words must be sought where they are used ; and in what pages , eminent for purity , can terms of manufacture or agriculture be found ? Many quotations serve no other purpose , than that of proving the bare existence of words , and are therefore selected with less scrupulousness than those which are to teach their structures and relations . My purpose was to admit no testimony of living authours , that I might not be misled by partiality , and that none of my cotemporaries might have reason to complain ; nor have I departed from this resolution , but when some performance of uncommon excellence excited my veneration , when my memory supplied me , from late books , with an example that was wanting , or when my heart	1750
likewise internal causes equally forcible . The language most likely to continue long without alteration , would be that of a nation raised a little , and but a little above barbarity , secluded from strangers , and totally employed in procuring the conveniencies of life ; either without books , or , like some of the Mahometan countries , with very few : men thus busied and unlearned , having only such words as common use requires , would perhaps long continue to express the same notions by the same signs . But no such constancy can be expected in a people polished by arts , and classed by subordination , where one part of the community is sustained and accommodated by the labour of the other . Those who have much leisure to think , will	1750

Most men think indistinctly , and therefore can not speak with exactness ; and consequently some examples might be indifferently put to either signification : this uncertainty is not to be imputed to me , who do not form , but register the language ; who do not teach men how they should think , but relate how they have hitherto expressed their thoughts . The imperfect sense of some examples I lamented , but could not remedy , and hope they will be compensated by innumerable passages selected with propriety , and preserved with exactness ; some shining with sparks of imagination , and some replete with treasures	1750
derivation . In any case of doubt or difficulty , it will be always proper to examine all the words of the same race ; for some words are slightly passed over to avoid repetition , some admitted easier and clearer explanation than others , and all will be better understood , as they are considered in greater variety of structures and relations . All the interpretations of words are not written with the same skill , or the same happiness : things equally easy in themselves , are not all equally easy to any single mind .

the same privilege with my predecessors of being sometimes credited without proof . The words , thus selected and disposed , are grammatically considered ; they are referred to the different parts of speech ; traced , when they are irregularly inflected , through their various terminations ; and illustrated by observations , not indeed of great or striking importance , separately considered , but necessary to the elucidation of our language , and hitherto neglected or forgotten by English grammarians . That part of my work on which I expect malignity most frequently to fasten , is the explanation ; in which I can not hope to satisfy those , who are perhaps not inclined to be pleased ,	1750
penman endeavoured to express , as he could , the sounds which he was accustomed to pronounce or to receive , and vitiated in writing such words as were already vitiated in speech . The powers of the letters , when they were applied to a new language , must have been vague and unsettled , and therefore different hands would exhibit the same sound by different combinations . From this uncertain pronunciation arise in a great part the various dialects of the same country , which will always be observed to grow fewer , and less different , as books are multiplied ; and from this arbitrary	1750
single words may enter by thousands , and the fabrick of the tongue continue the same , but new phraseology changes much at once ; it alters not the single stones of the building , but the order of the columns . If an academy should be established for the cultivation of our stile , which I , who can never wish to see dependance multiplied , hope the spirit of English liberty will hinder or destroy , let them , instead of compiling grammars and dictionaries , endeavour , with all their influence , to stop the licence of translatours , whose idleness and ignorance , if it be suffered to proceed , will reduce us to babble a dialect of France . If the changes that we fear be thus irresistible , what remains but to acquiesce with	1750
is not made without inconvenience , even from worse to better . There is in constancy and stability a general and lasting advantage , which will always overbalance the slow improvements of gradual correction . Much less ought our written language to comply with the corruptions of oral utterance , or copy that which every variation of time or place makes different from itself , and imitate those changes , which will again be changed , while imitation is employed in observing them . This recommendation of steadiness and uniformity does not proceed from an opinion , that particular combinations of letters have much influence on human happiness ; or that truth may not be successfully taught by modes of spelling fanciful And erroneous : I am not yet so lost in lexicography , as to I forget that WORDS ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF EARTH , AND	1750
whole performance . But many seeming faults are to be imputed rather to the nature of the undertaking , than the negligence of the performer . Thus some explanations are unavoidably reciprocal or circular , as hind , the female of the stag ; stag , the male of the hind : sometimes easier words are changed into harder , as burial into sepulture or interment , drier into desiccative , dryness into siccity or aridity , fit into paroxysm ; for the easiest word , whatever it be , can never be translated into one more easy . But easiness and difficulty are merely relative , and if the present prevalence of our language should invite foreigners to this dictionary , many will be assisted by those words which now seem only to increase or	1750

The words which are represented as thus related by descent or cognation , do not always agree in sense ; for it is incident to words , as to their authours , to degenerate	1750
, have neglected those in which our words are commonly to be sought . Thus Hammond writes fecibleness for feasibleness , because I suppose he imagined it derived immediately from the Latin ; and some words , such as dependant , dependent , dependance , dependence , vary their final syllable , as one or another language is present to the writer . In this part of the work , where caprice has long wantoned without controul , and vanity sought praise by petty reformation , I have endeavoured to proceed with a scholar 's reverence for antiquity , and a grammarian 's regard to the genius of our tongue . I have attempted few alterations , and among those few , perhaps the greater part is from the modern to the ancient practice ; and I hope I may be allowed to recommend	1750
to want what they must have wanted likewise , had they not luckily been so supplied . Nor are all words which are not found in the vocabulary , to be lamented as omissions . Of the laborious and mercantile part of the people , the diction is in a great measure casual and mutable ; many of their terms are formed for some temporary or local convenience , and though current at certain times and places , are in others utterly unknown . This fugitive cant , which is always in a state of increase or decay , can not be regarded as any part of the durable materials of a language , and therefore must	1750
participial adjectives . But neither are these always inserted , because they are commonly to be understood , without any danger of mistake , by consulting the verb . Obsolete words are admitted , when they are found in authours not obsolete , or when they have any force or beauty that may deserve revival . As composition is one of the chief characteristicks of a language , I have endeavoured to make some reparation for the universal negligence of my predecessors , by inserting great numbers of compounded words , as may be found under after , fore , new , night , fair , and many more . These , numerous as they are , might be multiplied , but that use and curiosity are here	1750
be accurately compiled , or skilfully examined . Some senses however there are , which , though not the same , are yet so nearly allied , that they are often confounded . Most men think indistinctly , and therefore can not speak with exactness ; and consequently some examples might be indifferently put to either signification : this uncertainty is not to be imputed to me , who do not form , but register the language ; who do not teach men how they should think , but relate how they have hitherto expressed their thoughts . The imperfect sense of some examples I lamented , but could not remedy , and hope they will be compensated by innumerable passages selected with propriety , and preserved with exactness ; some shining with sparks of imagination , and some replete with treasures of wisdom . The	1750
favourable accident , or easy enquiry brought within my reach , has not been neglected ; but it had been a hopeless labour to glean up words , by courting living information , and contesting with the sullenness of one , and the roughness of another . To furnish the academicians della Crusca with words of this kind , a series of comedies called la Fiera , or the Fair , was professedly written by Buonaroti ; but I had no such assistant , and therefore was content to want what they must have wanted likewise , had they not luckily been so supplied . Nor are all words which are not found in the vocabulary , to be lamented as omissions . Of the laborious and mercantile part of the people , the diction is in a	1750
they will always be mixed , where the chief part of education , and the most conspicuous accomplishment , is skill in ancient or in foreign tongues . He that has long cultivated another language , will find its words and combinations croud upon his memory ; and haste and negligence , refinement and affectation , will obtrude borrowed terms and exotick expressions . The great pest of speech is frequency of translation . No book was ever turned from one language into another , without imparting something of its native idiom ; this is the most mischievous and comprehensive innovation ; single words may enter by thousands , and the fabrick of the tongue continue the same , but new phraseology changes much	1750
obliged to sacrifice uniformity to custom ; thus I write , in compliance with a numberless majority , convey and inveigh , deceit and receipt , fancy and phantom ; sometimes the derivative varies from the primitive , as explain and explanation , repeat and repetition . Some combinations of letters having the same power are used indifferently without any discoverable reason of choice , as in choak , choke ; soap , sope ; jewel , fuel , and many others ; which I have sometimes inserted twice , that those who search for them under either form , may not search in vain . In	1750
the use of new , or extend the signification of known terms . The tropes of poetry will make hourly encroachments , and the metaphorical will become the current sense : pronunciation will be varied by levity or ignorance , and the pen must at length comply with the tongue ; illiterate writers will at one time or other , by publick infatuation , rise into renown , who , not knowing the original import of words , will use them with colloquial licentiousness , confound distinction , and forget propriety . As politeness increases , some expressions will be considered as too gross and vulgar for the delicate , others as too formal and ceremonious for the gay and airy ; new phrases are therefore adopted , which must , for the	1750
range this accumulation of elegance and wisdom into an alphabetical series , I soon discovered that the bulk of my volumes would fright away the student , and was forced to depart from my scheme of including all that was pleasing or useful in English literature , and reduce my transcripts very often to clusters of words , in which scarcely any meaning is retained ; thus to the weariness of copying , I was condemned to add the vexation of expunging . Some passages I have yet spared , which may relieve the labour of verbal searches , and intersperse with verdure and flowers the dusty desarts of barren philology . The examples , thus mutilated , are no longer to be considered as conveying the sentiments or doctrine of their authours ; the word for the sake of	1750
genealogy of sentiments , by shewing how one authour copied the thoughts and diction of another : such quotations are indeed little more than repetitions , which might justly be censured , did they not gratify the mind , by affording a kind of intellectual history . The various syntactical structures occurring in the examples have been carefully noted ; the licence or negligence with which many words have been hitherto used , has made our stile capricious and indeterminate ; when the different combinations of the same word are exhibited together , the preference is readily given to propriety , and I have often endeavoured to direct the choice . Thus have I laboured by settling the orthography , displaying the analogy , regulating the structures , and ascertaining the signification of English words , to perform all the parts of a	1750

To furnish the academicians della Crusca with words of this kind , a series of comedies called la Fiera , or the Fair , was professedly written by Buonaroti ; but I had no such assistant , and therefore was content to want what they must have wanted likewise , had they not luckily been so supplied .

So far have I been from any care to grace my pages with modern decorations , that I have studiously endeavoured to collect examples and authorities from the writers before the restoration , whose works I regard as the wells of English undefiled , as the pure sources of genuine diction . Our language , for almost a century , has , by the concurrence of many causes , been gradually departing from its original Teutonick character , and deviating towards a Gallick structure and phraseology ,	1750
those that can be referred to any word in English of greater simplicity . The derivatives I have referred to their primitives , with an accuracy sometimes needless ; for who does not see that remoteness comes from remote , lovely from love , concavity from concave , and demonstrative from demonstrate ? but this grammatical exuberance the scheme of my work did not allow me to repress . It is of great importance in examining the general fabrick of a language , to trace one word from another , by noting the usual modes of derivation and inflection ; and uniformity must be preserved in systematical works , though sometimes at the expence of particular propriety . Among other derivatives I have been careful to insert and elucidate the anomalous plurals of nouns and preterites of verbs	1750

Commerce , however necessary , however lucrative , as it depraves the manners , corrupts the language ; they that have frequent intercourse with strangers , to whom they endeavour to accommodate themselves , must in time learn a mingled dialect , like the jargon which serves the traffickers on the Mediterranean and Indian coasts .

our language should invite foreigners to this dictionary , many will be assisted by those words which now seem only to increase or produce obscurity . For this reason I have endeavoured frequently to join a Teutonick and Roman interpretation , as to cheer , to gladden , or exhilarate , that every learner of English may be assisted by his own tongue . The solution of all difficulties , and the supply of all defects , must be sought in the examples , subjoined to the various senses of each word , and ranged according to the time of their authours . When first I collected these authorities , I was desirous that every quotation should be useful to some other end than the illustration of a word ; I therefore extracted	1750
the modern to the ancient practice ; and I hope I may be allowed to recommend to those , whose thoughts have been perhaps employed too anxiously on verbal singularities , not to disturb , upon narrow views , or for minute propriety , the orthography of their fathers . It has been asserted , that for the law to be KNOWN , is of more importance than to be RIGHT . Change , says Hooker , is not made without inconvenience , even from worse to better . There is in constancy and stability a general and lasting advantage , which will always overbalance the	1750
word , the mode of spelling by which it is inserted in the series of the dictionary , is to be considered as that to which I give , perhaps not often rashly , the preference . I have left , in the examples , to every authour his own practice unmolested , that the reader may balance suffrages , and judge between us : but this question is not always to be determined by reputed or by real learning ; some men , intent upon greater things , have thought little on sounds and derivations ; some , knowing in the ancient tongues , have neglected those in which our words are commonly to be sought . Thus Hammond writes fecibleness for feasibleness , because	1750
conquests and migrations are now very rare : but there are other causes of change , which , though slow in their operation , and invisible in their progress , are perhaps as much superiour to human resistance , as the revolutions of the sky , or intumescence of the tide . Commerce , however necessary , however lucrative , as it depraves the manners , corrupts the language ; they that have frequent intercourse with strangers , to whom they endeavour to accommodate themselves , must in time learn a mingled dialect , like the jargon which serves the traffickers on the Mediterranean and Indian coasts .

general tendency of the sentence may be changed : the divine may desert his tenets , or the philosopher his system . Some of the examples have been taken from writers who were never mentioned as masters of elegance or models of stile ; but words must be sought where they are used ; and in what pages , eminent for purity , can terms of manufacture or agriculture be found ? Many quotations serve no other purpose , than that of proving the bare existence of words , and are therefore selected with less scrupulousness than those which are to teach their structures and relations . My purpose was to admit no	1750
the anomalous plurals of nouns and preterites of verbs , which in the Teutonick dialects are very frequent , and though familiar to those who have always used them , interrupt and embarrass the learners of our language . The two languages from which our primitives have been derived are the Roman and Teutonick : under the Roman I comprehend the French and provincial tongues ; and under the Teutonick range the Saxon , German , and all their kindred dialects . Most of our polysyllables are Roman , and our words of one syllable are very often Teutonick . In assigning the Roman original , it has perhaps sometimes happened that I have mentioned only the Latin , when the word was borrowed from the French , and considering myself as employed only in the illustration of my own language , I have not been very careful	1750
traced , when they are irregularly inflected , through their various terminations ; and illustrated by observations , not indeed of great or striking importance , separately considered , but necessary to the elucidation of our language , and hitherto neglected or forgotten by English grammarians . That part of my work on which I expect malignity most frequently to fasten , is the explanation ; in which I can not hope to satisfy those , who are perhaps not inclined to be pleased , since I have not always been able to satisfy myself . To interpret a language by itself	1750
which it condemns ; yet it may gratify curiosity to inform it , that the English Dictionary was written with little assistance of the learned , and without any patronage of the great ; not in the soft obscurities of retirement , or under the shelter of academick bowers , but amidst inconvenience and distraction , in sickness and in sorrow . It may repress the triumph of malignant criticism to observe , that if our language is not here fully displayed , I have only failed in an attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed . If the lexicons of ancient tongues , now immutably fixed , and comprised in a few volumes ,	1750
or technical . But these were the dreams of a poet doomed at last to wake a lexicographer . I soon found that it is too late to look for instruments , when the work calls for execution , and that whatever abilities I had brought to my task , with those I must finally perform it . To deliberate whenever I doubted , to enquire whenever I was ignorant , would have protracted the undertaking without end , and , perhaps , without much improvement ; for I did not find by my first experiments , that that I had not of my own was easily to be obtained : I saw that one enquiry only gave occasion to another , that book referred to book , that to search was not always to find , and to find was not always to be informed ; and that thus	1750
from demonstrate ? but this grammatical exuberance the scheme of my work did not allow me to repress . It is of great importance in examining the general fabrick of a language , to trace one word from another , by noting the usual modes of derivation and inflection ; and uniformity must be preserved in systematical works , though sometimes at the expence of particular propriety . Among other derivatives I have been careful to insert and elucidate the anomalous plurals of nouns and preterites of verbs , which in the Teutonick dialects are very frequent , and though familiar to	1750
, endeavour , with all their influence , to stop the licence of translatours , whose idleness and ignorance , if it be suffered to proceed , will reduce us to babble a dialect of France . If the changes that we fear be thus irresistible , what remains but to acquiesce with silence , as in the other insurmountable distresses of humanity ? It remains that we retard what we can not repel , that we palliate what we can not cure . Life may be lengthened by care , though death can not be ultimately defeated : tongues , like governments , have a natural tendency to degeneration ;	1750
be found under after , fore , new , night , fair , and many more . These , numerous as they are , might be multiplied , but that use and curiosity are here satisfied , and the frame of our language and modes of our combination amply discovered . Of some forms of composition , such as that by which re is prefixed to note repetition , and un to signify contrariety or privation , all the examples can not be accumulated , because the use of these particles , if not wholly arbitrary , is so little limited , that they are hourly affixed to new words as occasion requires , or is imagined to require them . There is another kind of	1750
for the boundary , beyond which I make few excursions . From the authours which rose in the time of Elizabeth , a speech might be formed adequate to all the purposes of use and elegance . If the language of theology were extracted from Hooker and the translation of the Bible ; the terms of natural knowledge from Bacon ; the phrases of policy , war , and navigation from Raleigh ; the dialect of poetry and fiction from Spenser and Sidney ; and the diction of common life from Shakespeare , few ideas would be lost to mankind , for want of English words , in which they might be expressed . It is not sufficient that a word is found , unless it be so combined as that its meaning is apparently determined by the tract and tenour of the sentence ; such passages	1750
be left to time : much of my life has been lost under the pressures of disease ; much has been trifled away ; and much has always been spent in provision for the day that was passing over me ; but I shall not think my employment useless or ignoble , if by my assistance foreign nations , and distant ages , gain access to the propagators of knowledge , and understand the teachers of truth ; if my labours afford light to the repositories of science , and add celebrity to Bacon , to Hooker , to Milton , and to Boyle . When I am animated by this wish , I look with pleasure on	1750
all will be better understood , as they are considered in greater variety of structures and relations . All the interpretations of words are not written with the same skill , or the same happiness : things equally easy in themselves , are not all equally easy to any single mind . Every writer of a long work commits errours , where there appears neither ambiguity to mislead , nor obscurity to confound him ; and in a search like this , many felicities of expression will be casually overlooked , many convenient parallels will be forgotten , and many particulars will admit improvement from a mind utterly unequal to	1750

The votaries of the northern muses will not perhaps easily restrain their indignation , when they find the name of Junius thus degraded by a disadvantageous comparison ; but whatever reverence is due to his diligence , or his attainments , it can be no criminal degree of censoriousness to charge that etymologist with want of judgment , who can seriously derive dream from drama , because life is a drama , and a drama is a dream ? and who declares with a tone of	1750

increased by a class of verbs too frequent in the English language , of which the signification is so loose and general , the use so vague and indeterminate , and the senses detorted so widely from the first idea , that it is hard to trace them through the maze of variation , to catch them on the brink of utter inanity , to circumscribe them by any limitations , or interpret them by any words of distinct and settled meaning ; such are bear , break , come , cast , full , get , give , do , put , set , go , run , make , take , turn , throw . If of these the whole power is not accurately delivered , it must be remembered , that while our language is yet living , and	1750
or appellative , I have omitted all words which have relation to proper names ; such as Arian , Socinian , Calvinist , Benedictine , Mahometan ; but have retained those of a more general nature , as Heathen , Pagan . Of the terms of art I have received such as could be found either in books of science or technical dictionaries ; and have often inserted , from philosophical writers , words which are supported perhaps only by a single authority , and which being not admitted into general use , stand yet as candidates or probationers , and must depend for their adoption on the suffrage of futurity . The words which our authours have introduced by their knowledge of foreign	1750

in various minds , the words by which such notions are conveyed , or such things denoted , will be ambiguous and perplexed . And such is the fate of hapless lexicography , that not only darkness , but light , impedes and distresses it ; things may be not only too little , but too much known , to be happily illustrated . To explain , requires the use of terms less abstruse than that which is to be explained , and such terms can not always be found ; for as nothing can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known , and evident without proof , so nothing can be defined but by	1750

Words arbitrarily formed by a constant and settled analogy , like diminutive adjectives in ish , as greenish , bluish , adverbs in ly , as dully , openly , substantives in ness , as vileness , faultiness , were less diligently sought , and sometimes have been omitted , when I had no authority that invited me to insert them ; not that they are not genuine and regular offsprings of English roots , but because their relation to the primitive being always the same , their signification can not be mistaken . The verbal nouns in ing , such as the keeping of the castle , the leading of the army , are always neglected , or placed only to illustrate the sense	1750
design , determining to confide in myself , and no longer to solicit auxiliaries , which produced more incumbrance than assistance : by this I obtained at least one advantage , that I set limits to my work , which would in time be ended , though not completed . Despondency has never so far prevailed as to depress me to negligence ; some faults will at last appear to be the effects of anxious diligence and persevering activity . The nice and subtle ramifications of meaning were not easily avoided by a mind intent upon accuracy , and convinced of the necessity of disentangling combinations , and separating similitudes . Many of the distinctions which to common readers appear useless and idle , will be found real and important by men versed in the school philosophy , without which no dictionary shall ever be accurately compiled ,	1750
established for the cultivation of our stile , which I , who can never wish to see dependance multiplied , hope the spirit of English liberty will hinder or destroy , let them , instead of compiling grammars and dictionaries , endeavour , with all their influence , to stop the licence of translatours , whose idleness and ignorance , if it be suffered to proceed , will reduce us to babble a dialect of France . If the changes that we fear be thus irresistible , what remains but to acquiesce with silence , as in the other insurmountable distresses of humanity ? It remains that we retard what we can not repel , that we palliate what we can not cure . Life may be lengthened by care , though death can	1750

These I have noted with great care ; and though I can not flatter myself that the collection is complete , I believe I have so far assisted the students of	1750

The eldest son , who succeeded to the earldom , died in , and left a son , George , who was for a time insane , and lived until . As George left no child , the title and estates passed to Horace Walpole , then seventy-four years old , and the only uncle who survived . Horace Walpole thus became Earl of Orford , during the last six years of his life . As to the title , he said that he felt himself being called	1760

She used indeed to sigh and lift up her eyes in your company , because she knows you are a saint ; but when your back was turned— ” “ You wrong her , ” said Matilda ; “ Isabella is no hypocrite ; she has a due sense of devotion , but never affected a call she has not . On the contrary , she always combated my inclination for the cloister ; and though I own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me ; though it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us ; I can not forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking	1760

Say but , adored Lady , that I have thy gentle pity. ” “ Stay , ” said Matilda ; “ I will conduct thee to the subterraneous vault by which Isabella escaped ; it will lead thee to the church of St. Nicholas , where thou mayst take sanctuary. ” “ What ! ” said Theodore , “ was it another , and not thy lovely self that I assisted to find the subterraneous passage ? ” “ It was , ” said Matilda ; “ but ask no more ; I tremble to see	1760
mind , and not commiserate it ? ” “ Not pity my child ! ” said Hippolita , catching Matilda in her arms— “ Oh ! I know she is good , she is all virtue , all tenderness , and duty . I do forgive thee , my excellent , my only hope ! ” The princesses then revealed to Hippolita their mutual inclination for Theodore , and the purpose of Isabella to resign him to Matilda . Hippolita blamed their imprudence , and showed them the improbability that either father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a man , though nobly born . Some comfort it gave her to find their passion of so recent a date , and that Theodore had had but little cause to	1760
as such , some apology for it is necessary . Miracles , visions , necromancy , dreams , and other preternatural events , are exploded now even from romances . That was not the case when our author wrote ; much less when the story itself is supposed to have happened . Belief in every kind of prodigy was so established in those dark ages , that an author would not be faithful to the manners of the times , who should omit all mention of them . He is not bound to believe them himself , but he must represent his actors as believing them . If this air of the miraculous is excused , the reader will find nothing else unworthy of his perusal . Allow the possibility of the facts , and all the actors comport themselves as persons would do in	1760
; I heard nothing to the contrary—yet , methinks , the Prince ’ s earnestness—Well , brother , but where is the Lady Isabella ? ” “ I know not , ” said the Friar ; “ she wept much , and said she would retire to her chamber. ” Jerome left his comrade abruptly , and hastened to the Princess , but she was not in her chamber . He inquired of the domestics of the convent , but could learn no news of her . He searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church , and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood , to get intelligence if she had been seen ; but to no purpose . Nothing could equal the good man ’ s perplexity . He judged that Isabella , suspecting Manfred of having precipitated his wife ’ s death , had taken the alarm	1760
feet . “ Behold my bosom ; strike , my Lord , if you suspect that a disloyal thought is lodged there . There is not a sentiment engraven on my heart that does not venerate you and yours. ” The grace and fervour with which Theodore uttered these words interested every person present in his favour . Even Manfred was touched—yet still possessed with his resemblance to Alfonso , his admiration was dashed with secret horror . “ Rise , ” said he ; “ thy life is not my present purpose . But tell me thy history , and how thou camest connected with this old traitor here. ”	1760
Matilda . “ She is in her own chamber , Madam , and has asked for you. ” Manfred had risen at the first dawn of light , and gone to Hippolita ’ s apartment , to inquire if she knew aught of Isabella . While he was questioning her , word was brought that Jerome demanded to speak with him . Manfred , little suspecting the cause of the Friar ’ s arrival , and knowing he was employed by Hippolita in her charities , ordered him to be admitted , intending to leave them together , while he pursued his search after Isabella . “ Is your business with me or the Princess ? ” said Manfred . “ With both , ” replied the holy man . “ The Lady Isabella— ” “ What of her ? ” interrupted Manfred , eagerly . “ Is at St.	1760
jealousy of innocence than dismay , he asked , with respect , of what he was guilty ? Manfred , more enraged at the vigour , however decently exerted , with which the young man had shaken off his hold , than appeased by his submission , ordered his attendants to seize him , and , if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials , would have poignarded the peasant in their arms . During this altercation , some of the vulgar spectators had run to the great church , which stood near the castle ,	1760
she would not go to rest , but would watch till the Princess should rise . The young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of Isabella , and on the threats of Manfred to her mother . “ But what business could he have so urgent with the chaplain ? ” said Matilda , “ Does he intend to have my brother ’ s body interred privately in the chapel ? ” “ Oh , Madam ! ” said Bianca , “ now I guess . As you are become his heiress , he is impatient to have you married : he has always been raving for more sons ; I warrant he is now impatient for grandsons . As sure as I	1760
this frame of mind , and determined to open her heart entirely to Matilda , she went to that Princess ’ s chamber , whom she found already dressed , and leaning pensively on her arm . This attitude , so correspondent to what she felt herself , revived Isabella ’ s suspicions , and destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend . They blushed at meeting , and were too much novices to disguise their sensations with address . After some unmeaning questions and replies , Matilda demanded of Isabella the cause of her flight ? The latter , who had almost forgotten Manfred ’ s passion , so entirely was she occupied by her own , concluding that Matilda referred to her last escape from the convent , which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening ,	1760
head . “ Sir Knight , ” said Manfred , warmly , “ Ricardo was a valiant and upright man ; he was a pious man ; witness his munificent foundation of the adjoining church and two convents . He was peculiarly patronised by St. Nicholas—my grandfather was incapable—I say , Sir , Don Ricardo was incapable—excuse me , your interruption has disordered me . I venerate the memory of my grandfather . Well , Sirs , he held this estate ; he held it by his good sword and by the favour of St. Nicholas—so did my father ; and so , Sirs , will I , come what come will . But Frederic , your Lord , is nearest in blood . I have consented to put my title to the	1760

I am sure he is the saint I pray to for a husband. ” “ Perhaps my mind would be less affected , ” said Matilda , “ if my mother would explain her reasons to me : but it is the mystery she observes , that inspires me with this—I know not what to call it . As she never acts from caprice , I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom—nay , I know there is :	1760
regard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents. ” “ Curse on Hippolita ! ” cried Manfred . “ Forget her from this moment , as I do . In short , Lady , you have missed a husband undeserving of your charms : they shall now be better disposed of . Instead of a sickly boy , you shall have a husband in the prime of his age , who will know how to value your beauties , and who may expect a numerous offspring. ” “ Alas , my Lord ! ” said Isabella , “	1760
grief deprived her of her senses , and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon . Isabella and Frederic , who attended her , were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow . Matilda alone seemed insensible to her own situation : every thought was lost in tenderness for her mother . Ordering the litter to stop , as soon as Hippolita was brought to herself , she asked for her father . He approached , unable to speak . Matilda , seizing his hand and her mother ’ s , locked them in her own , and then clasped them to her heart . Manfred could not support this act of pathetic piety . He dashed himself on the ground , and cursed the day he was born . Isabella , apprehensive that these struggles of passion were more than Matilda could support	1760
; “ but while I have life to ask it—oh ! my mother ! what will she feel ? Will you comfort her , my Lord ? Will you not put her away ? Indeed she loves you ! Oh , I am faint ! bear me to the castle . Can I live to have her close my eyes ? ” Theodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be borne into the convent ; but her instances were so pressing to be carried to the castle , that placing her on a litter , they conveyed her thither as she requested . Theodore , supporting her head with his arm , and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love , still endeavoured to inspire her with hopes	1760
for this dear youth ’ s safety ? ” “ For me ! ” cried Theodore . “ Let me die a thousand deaths , rather than stain thy conscience . What is it the tyrant would exact of thee ? Is the Princess still safe from his power ? Protect her , thou venerable old man ; and let all the weight of his wrath fall on me. ” Jerome endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth ; and ere Manfred could reply , the trampling of horses was heard , and a brazen trumpet , which hung without the gate of the castle , was suddenly	1760
me ! I was but in jest. ” “ It is the wind , ” said Matilda , “ whistling through the battlements in the tower above : you have heard it a thousand times. ” “ Nay , ” said Bianca , “ there was no harm neither in what I said : it is no sin to talk of matrimony—and so , Madam , as I was saying , if my Lord Manfred should offer you a handsome young Prince for a bridegroom , you would drop him a curtsey , and tell him you would rather take the veil ? ” “ Thank Heaven ! I am in no such danger , ” said Matilda : “ you know how many proposals for me he has rejected— ” “ And you thank him	1760
of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice . I can not flatter myself with having done justice to my author in this respect : his style is as elegant as his conduct of the passions is masterly . It is a pity that he did not apply his talents to what they were evidently proper for—the theatre . I will detain the reader no longer , but to make one short remark . Though the machinery is invention , and the names of the actors imaginary , I can not but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on truth . The scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle . The author seems frequently , without design , to	1760
sounding of the brazen trumpet . “ Father ! ” said he to Jerome , whom he now ceased to treat as Count of Falconara , “ what mean these portents ? If I have offended— ” the plumes were shaken with greater violence than before . “ Unhappy Prince that I am , ” cried Manfred . “ Holy Father ! will you not assist me with your prayers ? ” “ My Lord , ” replied Jerome , “ heaven is no doubt displeased with your mockery of its servants . Submit yourself to the church ; and cease to persecute her ministers . Dismiss this innocent youth ; and learn to respect the holy character I wear . Heaven will not be trifled	1760
the orisons which , I know not why , she has enjoined me to pour forth at his tomb , all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or other my destiny is linked with something relating to him. ” “ Lord , Madam ! how should that be ? ” said Bianca ; “ I have always heard that your family was in no way related to his : and I am sure I can not conceive why my Lady , the Princess , sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb : he is no saint by the almanack . If you must pray , why does she not bid you address yourself to our great St. Nicholas ? I am sure he is the saint I pray to	1760
the point . Ye require me to deliver up the Lady Isabella . Sirs , I must ask if ye are authorised to receive her ? ” The Knight nodded . “ Receive her , ” continued Manfred ; “ well , you are authorised to receive her , but , gentle Knight , may I ask if you have full powers ? ” The Knight nodded . “ ’ Tis well , ” said Manfred ; “ then hear what I have to offer . Ye see , gentlemen , before you , the most unhappy of men ! ” ( he began to weep	1760
he covered under pretence of the improbability that Frederic , the nearest of blood to Alfonso , and who was come to claim his succession , would yield to an alliance with the usurper of his right . But nothing could equal the perplexity of the Friar , when Hippolita confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation , and demanded his opinion on the legality of her acquiescence . The Friar caught eagerly at her request of his advice , and without explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of Manfred and Isabella , he painted to Hippolita in the most alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent , denounced judgments against her if she complied , and enjoined her in the severest terms to treat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal . Manfred , in the	1760
mood he roved insensibly to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits , and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits . He recollected to have heard this tradition ; and being of a brave and adventurous disposition , he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth . He had not penetrated far before he thought he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him . Theodore , though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be believed , had no	1760
feared if Manfred had no hope of recovering Isabella , that his impatience for a son would direct him to some other object , who might not be equally proof against the temptation of Manfred ’ s rank . For some time the holy man remained absorbed in thought . At length , conceiving some hopes from delay , he thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from despairing of recovering Isabella . Her the Friar knew he could dispose , from her affection to Hippolita , and from the aversion she had expressed to him for Manfred ’ s addresses , to second his views , till the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce . With this intention , as if struck with the Prince ’ s scruples , he at length said : “ My Lord , I have been	1760
you , she entreats your consent to remain in sanctuary , till she can learn news of her father , or , by the certainty of his death , be at liberty , with the approbation of her guardians , to dispose of herself in suitable marriage. ” “ I shall give no such consent , ” said the Prince , “ but insist on her return to the castle without delay : I am answerable for her person to her guardians , and will not brook her being in any hands but my own. ” “ Your Highness will recollect whether that can any longer be proper , ” replied the Friar . “ I want no monitor , ” said Manfred , colouring	1760
Prince , that when Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land— ” “ Is this a season for explanations ? ” cried Theodore . “ Father , come and unite me to the Princess ; she shall be mine ! In every other thing I will dutifully obey you . My life ! my adored Matilda ! ” continued Theodore , rushing back into the inner chamber , “ will you not be mine ? Will you not bless your— ” Isabella made signs to him to be silent , apprehending the Princess was near her end . “ What , is she dead ? ” cried Theodore ; “ is it possible ! ” The violence of his exclamations brought Matilda to herself . Lifting up her eyes , she looked round for her mother . “ Life of	1760
treachery is designed on my part ; I hope none is intended on thine ; here take my gage ” ( giving him his ring ) : “ your friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality . Rest here until refreshments are brought . I will but give orders for the accommodation of your train , and return to you. ” The three Knights bowed as accepting his courtesy . Manfred directed the stranger ’ s retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital , founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception of pilgrims . As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the gate , the gigantic sword burst from the supporters , and falling to the ground opposite to the helmet , remained immovable . Manfred , almost hardened to preternatural appearances , surmounted the	1760
” said Matilda , “ if my mother would explain her reasons to me : but it is the mystery she observes , that inspires me with this—I know not what to call it . As she never acts from caprice , I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom—nay , I know there is : in her agony of grief for my brother ’ s death she dropped some words that intimated as much. ” “ Oh ! dear Madam , ” cried Bianca , “ what were they ? ” “ No , ” said Matilda , “ if a parent lets fall a word , and wishes it recalled , it is not for a child to utter it. ” “ What ! was she sorry for what she had said ? ” asked	1760
immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother , and fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child , she hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction ; yet solicitude for him , backed by the commands of her mother , encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had given ; a fault she had never been guilty of before . The gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his door . She heard him traverse his chamber backwards , and forwards with disordered steps ; a mood which increased her apprehensions . She was , however , just going to beg admittance	1760
, and though the warmth of my temper betrayed me into some unbecoming expressions , I honour your virtue , and wish to be indebted to you for the repose of my life and the preservation of my family. ” “ The will of heaven be done ! ” said the Friar . “ I am but its worthless instrument . It makes use of my tongue to tell thee , Prince , of thy unwarrantable designs . The injuries of the virtuous Hippolita have mounted to the throne of pity . By me thou art reprimanded for thy adulterous intention of repudiating her	1760
I am faint ! bear me to the castle . Can I live to have her close my eyes ? ” Theodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be borne into the convent ; but her instances were so pressing to be carried to the castle , that placing her on a litter , they conveyed her thither as she requested . Theodore , supporting her head with his arm , and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love , still endeavoured to inspire her with hopes of life . Jerome , on the other side , comforted her with discourses of heaven , and holding a crucifix before her , which she bathed with innocent	1760
says he , “ on the right hand ; ” “ the door on the left hand ; ” “ the distance from the chapel to Conrad ’ s apartment : ” these and other passages are strong presumptions that the author had some certain building in his eye . Curious persons , who have leisure to employ in such researches , may possibly discover in the Italian writers the foundation on which our author has built . If a catastrophe , at all resembling that which he describes , is believed to have given rise to this work , it will contribute to interest the reader , and will make the “ Castle of Otranto ” a still more moving story .

Thou art all my care now ! —Most dread Lord ! will you—will you grant me my poor boy ’ s life ? ” “ Return to thy convent , ” answered Manfred ; “ conduct the Princess hither ; obey me in what else thou knowest ; and I promise thee the life of thy son. ” “ Oh ! my Lord , ” said Jerome , “ is	1760
; ” the tears gushed from Jerome ’ s eyes , on whose countenance a thousand anxious passions stood expressed . “ Before she died , ” continued Theodore , “ she bound a writing about my arm under my garments , which told me I was the son of the Count Falconara. ” “ It is most true , ” said Jerome ; “ I am that wretched father. ” “ Again I enjoin thee silence , ” said Manfred : “ proceed. ” “ I remained in slavery , ” said Theodore , “ until within these two years , when attending on my master in his cruises , I was delivered by a Christian vessel , which overpowered the pirate ; and discovering myself to	1760
may be encouraged to reprint the original Italian , though it will tend to depreciate my own labour . Our language falls far short of the charms of the Italian , both for variety and harmony . The latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative . It is difficult in English to relate without falling too low or rising too high ; a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure language in common conversation . Every Italian or Frenchman of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice . I can not flatter myself with having done	1760
her mind . She condemned her rash flight , which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries were not likely to draw anybody to her assistance . Yet the sound seemed not to come from behind . If Manfred knew where she was , he must have followed her . She was still in one of the cloisters , and the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come . Cheered with this reflection , and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the Prince , she was going to advance , when a door that stood ajar , at some distance to the left , was opened gently : but ere her lamp , which she held up , could discover who opened it , the person retreated precipitately on seeing the	1760
” “ Repugnance ! no , I ’ ll warrant her , ” said Bianca ; “ he is as comely a youth as ever trod on Christian ground . We are all in love with him ; there is not a soul in the castle but would be rejoiced to have him for our Prince—I mean , when it shall please heaven to call your Highness to itself. ” “ Indeed ! ” said Manfred , “ has it gone so far ! oh ! this cursed Friar ! —but I must not lose time—go , Bianca , attend Isabella ; but I charge thee , not a word of what has passed . Find out how she is affected towards Theodore ; bring me good news , and that ring has a companion . Wait at the foot of the winding staircase :	1760
soul ever melts for the distressed , and she will relieve thee. ” “ I am indeed unhappy , ” said the stranger ; “ and I know not what wealth is . But I do not complain of the lot which Heaven has cast for me ; I am young and healthy , and am not ashamed of owing my support to myself—yet think me not proud , or that I disdain your generous offers . I will remember you in my orisons , and will pray for blessings on your gracious self and your noble mistress—if I sigh , Lady , it is for others , not for myself. ” “ Now I have it , Madam , ” said Bianca , whispering the Princess ; “	1760
man , my father , has informed me who I am. ” “ Thou ravest , ” said the Marquis . “ There is no Prince of Otranto but myself , now Manfred , by murder , by sacrilegious murder , has forfeited all pretensions. ” “ My Lord , ” said Jerome , assuming an air of command , “ he tells you true . It was not my purpose the secret should have been divulged so soon , but fate presses onward to its work . What his hot-headed passion has revealed , my tongue confirms . Know , Prince , that when Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land— ” “ Is this a season for explanations ? ” cried Theodore . “ Father , come and	1760
know it is the will of heaven , and for thy benefit. ” “ Do not deceive me , ” said Matilda . “ I will not marry Frederic until thou commandest it . Alas ! what will become of me ? ” “ Why that exclamation ? ” said Hippolita . “ I have promised thee to return— ” “ Ah ! my mother , ” replied Matilda , “ stay and save me from myself . A frown from thee can do more than all my father ’ s severity . I have given away my heart , and you alone can make me recall it. ” “ No more , ” said Hippolita ; “ thou must not relapse , Matilda. ” “ I can quit Theodore , ” said she , “ but must I wed another ? let me attend thee to	1760
attendants to remain concealed about the convent , and bring him instant notice , if any one from the castle should repair thither . CHAPTER V. Every reflection which Manfred made on the Friar ’ s behaviour , conspired to persuade him that Jerome was privy to an amour between Isabella and Theodore . But Jerome ’ s new presumption , so dissonant from his former meekness , suggested still deeper apprehensions . The Prince even suspected that the Friar depended on some secret support from Frederic , whose arrival , coinciding with the novel appearance of Theodore , seemed to bespeak a correspondence . Still more was he troubled with the resemblance of Theodore to Alfonso ’ s portrait	1760

Give me a sword , Lady , and thy father shall learn that Theodore scorns an ignominious flight. ” “ Rash youth ! ” said Matilda ; “ thou wouldst not dare to lift thy presumptuous arm against the Prince of Otranto ? ” “ Not against thy father ; indeed , I dare not , ” said Theodore . “ Excuse me , Lady ; I had forgotten . But could I gaze on thee , and remember thou art sprung from the tyrant Manfred ! But he is thy father , and from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion. ” A deep and hollow groan , which seemed to	1760

Did your Highness never hear what Count Marsigli offered me , when he came a wooing to my Lady Matilda ? ” “ I have not leisure , ” said Manfred , “ to listen to thy tale . I do not question thy honesty . But it is thy duty to conceal nothing from me . How long has Isabella been acquainted with Theodore ? ” “ Nay , there is nothing can escape your Highness ! ” said Bianca ; “ not that I know any thing of the matter . Theodore , to be sure , is a proper young man , and , as my Lady Matilda says ,	1760

As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the gate , the gigantic sword burst from the supporters , and falling to the ground opposite to the helmet , remained immovable . Manfred , almost hardened to preternatural appearances , surmounted the shock of this new prodigy ; and returning to the hall , where by this time the feast was ready , he invited his silent guests to take their places . Manfred , however ill his heart was at ease , endeavoured to inspire the company with mirth . He put several questions to them , but was answered only by signs .

This brave Knight—I know not who he is—will protect thy innocence . Sir , you will not abandon my child , will you ? ” Theodore , shedding tears over his victim , and vowing to guard the Princess at the expense of his life , persuaded Frederic to suffer himself to be conducted to the castle . They placed him on a horse belonging to one of the domestics , after binding up his wounds as well as they	1760
she always combated my inclination for the cloister ; and though I own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me ; though it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us ; I can not forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil . She wished to see me married , though my dower would have been a loss to her and my brother ’ s children . For her sake I will believe well of this young peasant. ” “ Then you do think there is some liking between them , ” said Bianca . While she was speaking , a servant came hastily into the chamber and told the Princess that the Lady Isabella was found . “ Where ? ” said Matilda . “ She has taken	1760
after Isabella . “ Is your business with me or the Princess ? ” said Manfred . “ With both , ” replied the holy man . “ The Lady Isabella— ” “ What of her ? ” interrupted Manfred , eagerly . “ Is at St. Nicholas ’ s altar , ” replied Jerome . “ That is no business of Hippolita , ” said Manfred with confusion ; “ let us retire to my chamber , Father , and inform me how she came thither. ” “ No , my Lord , ” replied the good man , with an air of firmness and authority , that daunted even the resolute Manfred , who could not help revering the saint-like virtues of Jerome ; “ my commission is to both , and with your Highness ’ s good-liking , in the presence of	1760
offer us a retreat. ” “ Thou guiltless but unhappy woman ! unhappy by my crimes ! ” replied Manfred , “ my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions . Oh ! could—but it can not be—ye are lost in wonder—let me at last do justice on myself ! To heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction I have left to offer to offended heaven . My story has drawn down these judgments : Let my confession atone—but , ah ! what can atone for usurpation and a murdered child ? a child murdered in a consecrated place ? List , sirs , and may this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants ! ” “ Alfonso , ye	1760

Frederic , falling on his knees , adjured the phantom to take pity on him . “ Dost thou not remember me ? ” said the apparition . “ Remember the wood of Joppa ! ” “ Art thou that holy hermit ? ” cried Frederic , trembling . “ Can I do aught for thy eternal peace ? ” “ Wast thou delivered from bondage , ” said the spectre , “ to pursue carnal delights ? Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre , and the behest of Heaven engraven on it ? ” “ I have not , I have not , ” said Frederic ; “ but say , blest spirit , what is thy errand to me ?

and all his courage revived . “ Usurper ! —insolent villain ! ” cried he ; “ who dares to question my title ? Retire , Father ; this is no business for Monks : I will meet this presumptuous man myself . Go to your convent and prepare the Princess ’ s return . Your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity : his life depends on your obedience. ” “ Good heaven ! my Lord , ” cried Jerome , “ your Highness did but this instant freely pardon my child—have you so soon forgot the interposition of heaven ? ” “ Heaven , ” replied Manfred , “ does not send Heralds to question the title of a lawful Prince . I doubt whether it	1760
pallet-bed , and the key of which he took away himself , telling the youth he would talk with him in the morning . Then dismissing his attendants , and bestowing a sullen kind of half-nod on Hippolita , he retired to his own chamber . CHAPTER II . Matilda , who by Hippolita ’ s order had retired to her apartment , was ill-disposed to take any rest . The shocking fate of her brother had deeply affected her . She was surprised at not seeing Isabella ; but the strange words which had fallen from her father , and his obscure menace to the Princess his wife ,	1760
’ s passion , so entirely was she occupied by her own , concluding that Matilda referred to her last escape from the convent , which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening , replied— “ Martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was dead. ” “ Oh ! ” said Matilda , interrupting her , “ Bianca has explained that mistake to me : on seeing me faint , she cried out , ‘ The Princess is dead ! ’ and Martelli , who had come for the usual dole to the castle— ” “ And	1760
’ s . He wished earnestly to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the Princess ; but fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her , he desisted . The only boon he deigned to ask was , that he might be permitted to have a confessor , and make his peace with heaven . Manfred , who hoped by the confessor ’ s means to come at the youth ’ s history , readily granted his request ; and being convinced that Father Jerome was now in his interest , he ordered him to be called and shrive the prisoner . The holy man , who had little foreseen the catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned , fell on his knees to the Prince , and adjured him in the most solemn manner not to	1760
” “ My Lord , ” interrupted one of them officiously , “ to be sure it was the trap-door , and he was going to make his escape. ” “ Peace , blockhead ! ” said the Prince angrily ; “ if he was going to escape , how should he come on this side ? I will know from his own mouth what noise it was I heard . Tell me truly ; thy life depends on thy veracity. ” “ My veracity is dearer to me than my life , ” said the peasant ; “ nor would I purchase the one by forfeiting the other. ” “ Indeed , young philosopher ! ” said Manfred contemptuously ; “ tell me , then ,	1760
s friends endeavour to divert him from this savage and ill-grounded resolution . The generality were charmed with their lord ’ s decision , which , to their apprehensions , carried great appearance of justice , as the Magician was to be punished by the very instrument with which he had offended : nor were they struck with the least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved , for they firmly believed that , by his diabolic skill , he could easily supply himself with nutriment . Manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed ; and appointing a guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the prisoner , he dismissed his friends and attendants , and retired to his own chamber , after locking the gates of the castle ,	1760
she had felt for many hours , she met her Lord , and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable ; and no doubt an impression made by fear , and the dark and dismal hour of the night , on the minds of his servants . She and the chaplain had examined the chamber , and found everything in the usual order . Manfred , though persuaded , like his wife , that the vision had been no work of fancy , recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown him . Ashamed	1760
not be—Isabella—Theodore—for my sake—Oh ! — ” she expired . Isabella and her women tore Hippolita from the corse ; but Theodore threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it . He printed a thousand kisses on her clay-cold hands , and uttered every expression that despairing love could dictate . Isabella , in the meantime , was accompanying the afflicted Hippolita to her apartment ; but , in the middle of the court , they were met by Manfred , who , distracted with his own thoughts , and anxious once more to behold his daughter , was advancing to the chamber where she lay . As the moon was now at its height , he read in the countenances of this unhappy company the	1760
! ” said the Marquis , penetrated with grief , and stopped . “ For the love of Heaven , my Lord , ” said Hippolita , “ disclose the cause of this transport ! What mean these doleful sounds , this alarming exclamation on my name ? What woes has heaven still in store for the wretched Hippolita ? Yet silent ! By every pitying angel , I adjure thee , noble Prince , ” continued she , falling at his feet , “ to disclose the purport of what lies at thy heart . I see thou feelest for me ; thou feelest the sharp pangs	1760
” “ Ask me what I can answer , ” said he , “ and put me to death instantly if I tell you a lie. ” Manfred , growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference of the youth , cried— “ Well , then , thou man of truth , answer ! Was it the fall of the trap-door that I heard ? ” “ It was , ” said the youth . “ It was ! ” said the Prince ; “ and how didst thou come to know there was a trap-door here ? ” “ I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine , ” replied he . “ But what told thee it was a lock ? ” said Manfred . “ How didst thou discover the secret of opening it ? ” “ Providence , that delivered me from	1760
pursuit . With this unhappy policy , he answered in a manner to confirm Manfred in the belief of some connection between Isabella and the youth . The Prince , whose passions wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze , fell into a rage at the idea of what the Friar suggested . “ I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue , ” cried he ; and quitting Jerome abruptly , with a command to remain there till his return , he hastened to the great hall of the castle , and ordered the peasant to be brought before him . “ Thou hardened young impostor !	1760
he would infallibly make throughout the castle ? As these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind , she recollected a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the church of St. Nicholas . Could she reach the altar before she was overtaken , she knew even Manfred ’ s violence would not dare to profane the sacredness of the place ; and she determined , if no other means of deliverance offered , to shut herself up for ever among the holy virgins whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral . In this resolution , she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase ,	1760
the claims of the two houses . This motive , on Conrad ’ s death , had co-operated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself ; and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the consent of Frederic to this marriage . A like policy inspired him with the thought of inviting Frederic ’ s champion into the castle , lest he should be informed of Isabella ’ s flight , which he strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight ’ s retinue . “ Herald , ” said Manfred , as soon as he had digested these reflections , “ return to thy master ,	1760
, ” said Matilda . “ But weep not for me , my mother ! I am going where sorrow never dwells—Isabella , thou hast loved me ; wouldst thou not supply my fondness to this dear , dear woman ? Indeed I am faint ! ” “ Oh ! my child ! my child ! ” said Hippolita in a flood of tears , “ can I not withhold thee a moment ? ” “ It will not be , ” said Matilda ; “ commend me to heaven—Where is my father ? forgive him , dearest mother—forgive him my death ; it was an error	1760
, prevent his engaging in any new pursuit . With this unhappy policy , he answered in a manner to confirm Manfred in the belief of some connection between Isabella and the youth . The Prince , whose passions wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze , fell into a rage at the idea of what the Friar suggested . “ I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue , ” cried he ; and quitting Jerome abruptly , with a command to remain there till his return , he hastened to the great hall of the castle , and ordered the peasant to be brought before him . “ Thou hardened young impostor ! ” said the Prince , as soon	1760
the visitation that has fallen on me in the death of Conrad ! —ease my conscience of this burden : dissolve our marriage , and accomplish the work of godliness—which your divine exhortations have commenced in my soul. ” How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt , when he perceived this turn in the wily Prince ! He trembled for Hippolita , whose ruin he saw was determined ; and he feared if Manfred had no hope of recovering Isabella , that his impatience for a son would direct him to some other object , who might not be equally proof against the temptation of Manfred ’ s rank . For some time the holy man remained absorbed in thought . At length , conceiving some hopes from delay , he thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from	1760
very words it had been uttered . The first sounds struck Manfred with terror ; but when he heard himself styled usurper , his rage rekindled , and all his courage revived . “ Usurper ! —insolent villain ! ” cried he ; “ who dares to question my title ? Retire , Father ; this is no business for Monks : I will meet this presumptuous man myself . Go to your convent and prepare the Princess ’ s return . Your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity : his life depends on your obedience. ” “ Good heaven ! my Lord , ” cried Jerome , “ your Highness did but	1760
my title ? Retire , Father ; this is no business for Monks : I will meet this presumptuous man myself . Go to your convent and prepare the Princess ’ s return . Your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity : his life depends on your obedience. ” “ Good heaven ! my Lord , ” cried Jerome , “ your Highness did but this instant freely pardon my child—have you so soon forgot the interposition of heaven ? ” “ Heaven , ” replied Manfred , “ does not send Heralds to question the title of a lawful Prince . I doubt whether it even notifies its will through Friars—but that is your affair , not mine .	1760
“ From the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre , ” said the Herald ; “ and I must speak with the usurper of Otranto. ” Jerome returned to the Prince , and did not fail to repeat the message in the very words it had been uttered . The first sounds struck Manfred with terror ; but when he heard himself styled usurper , his rage rekindled , and all his courage revived . “ Usurper ! —insolent villain ! ” cried he ; “ who dares to question my title ? Retire , Father ; this is no business for Monks : I will meet this presumptuous man	1760

Tell us , fair maiden ,	1760
_PARIS_ , _NEW YORK & MELBOURNE_ INTRODUCTION HORACE WALPOLE was the youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole , the great statesman , who died Earl of Orford . He was born in , the year in which his father resigned office , remaining in opposition for almost three years before his return to a long tenure of power . Horace Walpole was educated at Eton , where he formed a school friendship with Thomas Gray , who was but a few months older . In Gray was travelling-companion with Walpole in France and Italy until they differed and parted ; but the friendship was afterwards renewed , and remained firm to the end . Horace Walpole went from Eton	1760
meantime , had broken his purpose to Frederic , and proposed the double marriage . That weak Prince , who had been struck with the charms of Matilda , listened but too eagerly to the offer . He forgot his enmity to Manfred , whom he saw but little hope of dispossessing by force ; and flattering himself that no issue might succeed from the union of his daughter with the tyrant , he looked upon his own succession to the principality as facilitated by wedding Matilda . He made faint opposition to the proposal ; affecting , for form only , not to acquiesce unless Hippolita should consent to the divorce .	1760
art safe here ; be not alarmed. ” “ Oh ! your Greatness is wonderfully good , ” said Bianca , “ but I dare not—no , pray let me go—I had rather leave everything behind me , than stay another hour under this roof. ” “ Go to , thou hast lost thy senses , ” said Manfred . “ Interrupt us not ; we were communing on important matters—My Lord , this wench is subject to fits—Come with me , Bianca. ” “ Oh ! the Saints ! No , ” said Bianca , “ for certain it	1760
shall do your pleasure . But come , give me a goblet of wine ; ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses. ” The principal Knight sighed and crossed himself , and was rising from the board . “ Sir Knight , ” said Manfred , “ what I said was but in sport . I shall constrain you in nothing : use your good liking . Since mirth is not your mood , let us be sad . Business may hit your fancies better . Let us withdraw , and hear if what I have to	1760
“ It is , it is , ” cried Theodore . “ Alas ! there is no other ! ” “ Young man , thou art too unadvised , ” said Frederic . “ Dost thou think we are to listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate ? What pretensions hast thou to the Princess ? ” “ Those of a Prince , ” said Theodore ; “ of the sovereign of Otranto . This reverend man , my father , has informed me who I am. ” “ Thou ravest , ” said the Marquis . “ There is no Prince of Otranto but myself , now Manfred , by murder , by sacrilegious murder , has forfeited all pretensions. ” “ My Lord , ” said Jerome , assuming an air of command , “	1760
replied— “ I am no impostor , my Lord , nor have I deserved opprobrious language . I answered to every question your Highness put to me last night with the same veracity that I shall speak now : and that will not be from fear of your tortures , but because my soul abhors a falsehood . Please to repeat your questions , my Lord ; I am ready to give you all the satisfaction in my power. ” “ You know my questions , ” replied the Prince , “ and only want time to prepare an evasion . Speak directly ; who art thou ? and how long hast thou been known to the Princess ? ” “ I am a labourer at the next village , ” said the peasant ; “ my name is Theodore . The Princess found me in the vault last night	1760
said Isabella trembling . “ Recollect thyself , Matilda. ” “ No , Isabella , ” said the Princess , “ I should not deserve this incomparable parent , if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured a thought without her permission—nay , I have offended her ; I have suffered a passion to enter my heart without her avowal—but here I disclaim it ; here I vow to heaven and her— ” “ My child ! my child ; ” said Hippolita , “ what words are these ! what new calamities has fate in store for us ! Thou , a passion ? Thou , in this hour of destruction— ” “ Oh ! I see all my guilt ! ” said Matilda . “ I abhor myself , if I cost my mother a pang . She is the dearest thing I have on	1760
his heart , that he could not bear to absent himself at much distance from her abode . The tenderness Jerome had expressed for him concurred to confirm this reluctance ; and he even persuaded himself that filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the castle and monastery . Until Jerome should return at night , Theodore at length determined to repair to the forest that Matilda had pointed out to him . Arriving there , he sought the gloomiest shades , as best suited to the pleasing melancholy that reigned in his mind . In this mood	1760
with that excellent woman ! if ye knew that I adore her like a mistress , and cherish her as a friend—but man was not born for perfect happiness ! She shares my scruples , and with her consent I have brought this matter before the church , for we are related within the forbidden degrees . I expect every hour the definitive sentence that must separate us for ever—I am sure you feel for me—I see you do—pardon these tears ! ” The Knights gazed on each other , wondering where this would end . Manfred continued— “ The death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety , I	1760
she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred , that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad ’ s infirm state of health would permit . Manfred ’ s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours . The former , indeed , apprehending the severity of their Prince ’ s disposition , did not dare to utter their surmises on this precipitation . Hippolita , his wife , an amiable lady , did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early , considering his great youth , and greater infirmities ; but she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility , who had given him but one heir . His tenants and subjects were less cautious in their discourses . They attributed this hasty wedding to the	1760
no business for Monks : I will meet this presumptuous man myself . Go to your convent and prepare the Princess ’ s return . Your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity : his life depends on your obedience. ” “ Good heaven ! my Lord , ” cried Jerome , “ your Highness did but this instant freely pardon my child—have you so soon forgot the interposition of heaven ? ” “ Heaven , ” replied Manfred , “ does not send Heralds to question the title of a lawful Prince . I doubt whether it even notifies its will through Friars—but that is your affair ,	1760
abide here ; fly to the sanctuary. ” “ To sanctuary , ” said Theodore ; “ no , Princess ; sanctuaries are for helpless damsels , or for criminals . Theodore ’ s soul is free from guilt , nor will wear the appearance of it . Give me a sword , Lady , and thy father shall learn that Theodore scorns an ignominious flight. ” “ Rash youth ! ” said Matilda ; “ thou wouldst not dare to lift thy presumptuous arm against the Prince of Otranto ? ” “ Not against thy father ; indeed , I dare not , ” said Theodore . “ Excuse me , Lady ; I had forgotten	1760
is in love ; it can not be with you , for yesterday was the first time you ever met—was it not ? ” “ Certainly , ” replied Matilda ; “ but why does my dearest Isabella conclude from anything I have said , that ” —she paused—then continuing : “ he saw you first , and I am far from having the vanity to think that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to you ; may you be happy , Isabella , whatever is the fate of Matilda ! ” “ My lovely friend , ” said Isabella , whose heart was too honest to resist a kind expression , “ it is you that Theodore admires ; I saw	1760
almost a stranger to me : but as the surgeons have pronounced your father out of danger , you ought not to harbour uncharitable resentment against one , who I am persuaded did not know the Marquis was related to you. ” “ You plead his cause very pathetically , ” said Isabella , “ considering he is so much a stranger to you ! I am mistaken , or he returns your charity. ” “ What mean you ? ” said Matilda . “ Nothing , ” said Isabella , repenting that she had given Matilda a hint of Theodore ’ s inclination for her . Then changing the discourse , she asked Matilda what occasioned Manfred to take Theodore for a spectre	1760
companions. ” “ What ! my Lord , ” cried Bianca , “ do you think I have seen nothing ? go to the foot of the great stairs yourself—as I live I saw it. ” “ Saw what ? tell us , fair maid , what thou hast seen , ” said Frederic . “ Can your Highness listen , ” said Manfred , “ to the delirium of a silly wench , who has heard stories of apparitions until she believes them ? ” “ This is more than fancy , ” said the Marquis ; “ her terror is too natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination . Tell us , fair maiden , what it is has moved thee thus ? ” “ Yes , my Lord , thank your Greatness , ” said Bianca ; “ I believe I look	1760
Manfred , as they came nearer ; “ have you found the Princess ? ” The first that arrived , replied , “ Oh , my Lord ! I am glad we have found you. ” “ Found me ! ” said Manfred ; “ have you found the Princess ? ” “ We thought we had , my Lord , ” said the fellow , looking terrified , “ but— ” “ But , what ? ” cried the Prince ; “ has she escaped ? ” “ Jaquez and I , my Lord— ” “ Yes , I and Diego , ” interrupted the second , who came up in still greater consternation . “	1760
showing any impatience for the bridegroom , for whom , in truth , she had conceived little affection . The first thing that struck Manfred ’ s eyes was a group of his servants endeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable plumes . He gazed without believing his sight . “ What are ye doing ? ” cried Manfred , wrathfully ; “ where is my son ? ” A volley of voices replied , “ Oh ! my Lord ! the Prince ! the Prince ! the helmet ! the helmet ! ” Shocked with these lamentable sounds , and dreading he knew not what , he advanced hastily , —but what a sight for a father ’ s eyes ! —he beheld his child dashed to pieces ,	1760
make thy story known to him , as far as thou thinkest meet . He will not fail to inform the Princess , who is the mother of all that want her assistance . Farewell ; it is not seemly for me to hold farther converse with a man at this unwonted hour. ” “ May the saints guard thee , gracious Lady ! ” replied the peasant ; “ but oh ! if a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minute ’ s audience farther ; am I so happy ? the casement is not shut ; might I venture to ask— ” “ Speak quickly , ” said Matilda ; “ the morning dawns apace : should the	1760
it will accomplish its work , and strengthen my arm in thy cause . But come , Lady , we are too near the mouth of the cavern ; let us seek its inmost recesses . I can have no tranquillity till I have placed thee beyond the reach of danger. ” “ Alas ! what mean you , sir ? ” said she . “ Though all your actions are noble , though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul , is it fitting that I should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats ? Should we be found together , what would a censorious world think of my conduct ? ” “ I respect your virtuous delicacy , ” said Theodore ; “ nor do you harbour a suspicion that wounds	1760
! Beneath this marble monument rest the ashes of the good Alfonso ; a prince adorned with every virtue : the father of his people ! the delight of mankind ! Kneel , headstrong boy , and list , while a father unfolds a tale of horror that will expel every sentiment from thy soul , but sensations of sacred vengeance—Alfonso ! much injured prince ! let thy unsatisfied shade sit awful on the troubled air , while these trembling lips—Ha ! who comes there ? — ” “ The most wretched of women ! ” said Hippolita , entering the choir . “ Good Father , art thou at leisure ? —but why this kneeling youth ? what means the horror imprinted on each countenance ? why at this venerable tomb—alas ! hast thou	1760
generosity , each insisting on yielding her claim to her friend . At length the dignity of Isabella ’ s virtue reminding her of the preference which Theodore had almost declared for her rival , made her determine to conquer her passion , and cede the beloved object to her friend . During this contest of amity , Hippolita entered her daughter ’ s chamber . “ Madam , ” said she to Isabella , “ you have so much tenderness for Matilda , and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house , that I can have	1760
I am not talking , ” replied the Prince , impatiently , “ about her father ; I know he will do well. ” “ Bless me , I rejoice to hear your Highness say so ; for though I thought it not right to let my young Lady despond , methought his greatness had a wan look , and a something—I remember when young Ferdinand was wounded by the Venetian— ” “ Thou answerest from the point , ” interrupted Manfred ; “ but here , take this jewel , perhaps that may fix thy attention—nay , no reverences ; my favour shall not stop here—come ,	1760
to ask any questions that might tend to inflame Manfred ’ s wrath against his son . Jerome ’ s silence convinced Manfred that he had contrived Theodore ’ s release . “ And is it thus , thou ungrateful old man , ” said the Prince , addressing himself to the Friar , “ that thou repayest mine and Hippolita ’ s bounties ? And not content with traversing my heart ’ s nearest wishes , thou armest thy bastard , and bringest him into my own castle to insult me ! ” “ My Lord , ” said Theodore , “ you wrong my father : neither he nor I are capable of harbouring a thought against your peace . Is it insolence thus to surrender myself to your Highness ’ s pleasure ?	1760
” said he , “ surpasses all thy former insolence . Thou shalt experience the wrath with which thou darest to trifle . Seize him , ” continued Manfred , “ and bind him—the first news the Princess hears of her champion shall be , that he has lost his head for her sake. ” “ The injustice of which thou art guilty towards me , ” said Theodore , “ convinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering the Princess from thy tyranny . May she be happy , whatever becomes of me ! ” “ This is a lover ! ” cried Manfred in a rage :	1760
me emboldens—Lady ! dare I trust you ? ” “ Heavens ! ” said Matilda , “ what dost thou mean ? With what wouldst thou trust me ? Speak boldly , if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a virtuous breast. ” “ I would ask , ” said the peasant , recollecting himself , “ whether what I have heard from the domestics is true , that the Princess is missing from the castle ? ” “ What imports it to thee to know ? ” replied Matilda . “ Thy first words bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity . Dost thou come hither to pry into the secrets of Manfred ? Adieu .	1760
as I do ! My Lord , my gracious Sire , dost thou forgive thy child ? Indeed , I came not hither to meet Theodore . I found him praying at this tomb , whither my mother sent me to intercede for thee , for her—dearest father , bless your child , and say you forgive her. ” “ Forgive thee ! Murderous monster ! ” cried Manfred , “ can assassins forgive ? I took thee for Isabella ; but heaven directed my bloody hand to the heart of my child . Oh , Matilda ! —I can not utter it—canst thou forgive the blindness of my rage ? ” “ I can , I do ; and may heaven confirm it ! ” said Matilda ; “ but while I	1760
“ Grant me patience ! ” said Manfred ; “ these blockheads distract me . Out of my sight , Diego ! and thou , Jaquez , tell me in one word , art thou sober ? art thou raving ? thou wast wont to have some sense : has the other sot frightened himself and thee too ? Speak ; what is it he fancies he has seen ? ” “ Why , my Lord , ” replied Jaquez , trembling , “ I was going to tell your Highness , that since the calamitous misfortune of my young Lord , God rest his precious soul ! not one of us your Highness ’ s faithful servants—indeed we are , my Lord , though poor men—I say , not one	1760
who sends thee ? ” said Manfred . “ At the distance of a league , ” said the Herald : “ he comes to make good his Lord ’ s claim against thee , as he is a true knight , and thou an usurper and ravisher. ” Injurious as this challenge was , Manfred reflected that it was not his interest to provoke the Marquis . He knew how well founded the claim of Frederic was ; nor was this the first time he had heard of it . Frederic ’ s ancestors had assumed the style of Princes	1760
wheeled off to the right and left to make room for the principal Knight . As soon as he approached the gate he stopped ; and the herald advancing , read again the words of the challenge . Manfred ’ s eyes were fixed on the gigantic sword , and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel : but his attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him . He turned and beheld the Plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as before . It required intrepidity like Manfred ’ s not to sink under a	1760
he forgets the reverence he owes you ; but he is not accustomed— ” Hippolita , concerned at the heat that had arisen , checked Theodore for his boldness , but with an air acknowledging his zeal ; and changing the conversation , demanded of Frederic where he had left her Lord ? As the Marquis was going to reply , they heard a noise without , and rising to inquire the cause , Manfred , Jerome , and part of the troop , who had met an imperfect rumour of what had happened , entered the chamber . Manfred advanced hastily towards Frederic ’ s bed to condole with him on his misfortune , and to learn the circumstances of the combat , when starting in an agony of terror and amazement , he cried— “ Ha ! what art thou ? thou dreadful spectre ! is	1760

'' Osborne shouted indignantly . `` Why the devil is all the regiment to know that I am going to be married ? Why is that tattling old harridan , Peggy O'Dowd , to make free with my name at her d -- d supper-table , and advertise my engagement over the three kingdoms ? After all , what right have you to say I am engaged , or to meddle in my business at all , Dobbin ? '' `` It seems to me , '' Captain Dobbin began . `` Seems be hanged , Dobbin , '' his junior interrupted him . `` I am under obligations to you , I know it	1840
epaulets in which he looked so well . Money was always useful to this free-handed young fellow , and he took it without many words . The bills were up in the Sedley house , where he had passed so many , many happy hours . He could see them as he walked from home that night ( to the Old Slaughters ' , where he put up when in town ) shining white in the moon . That comfortable home was shut , then , upon Amelia and her parents : where had they taken refuge ? The thought of their	1840
, and a pretty pair they are ! '' When she comes into the country our hall is thrown open , and for a month , at least , you would fancy old Sir Walpole was come to life again . We have dinner-parties , and drive out in the coach-and-four -- the footmen put on their newest canary-coloured liveries ; we drink claret and champagne as if we were accustomed to it every day . We have wax candles in the schoolroom , and fires to warm ourselves with . Lady Crawley is made to put on the brightest pea-green in her wardrobe , and my pupils leave off their	1840
They sent him parcels , which , when opened , were found to contain the paternal soap and candles . There was no little fellow but had his jeer and joke at Dobbin ; and he bore everything quite patiently , and was entirely dumb and miserable . Cuff , on the contrary , was the great chief and dandy of the Swishtail Seminary . He smuggled wine in . He fought the town-boys . Ponies used to come for him to ride home on Saturdays . He had his top-boots in his room , in which he used to hunt in the holidays . He had a gold repeater : and took snuff like the Doctor . He had been to the Opera , and knew the merits of the principal actors , preferring Mr. Kean to Mr. Kemble . He could	1840

Rebecca performed her part so well , and with such ghastly truth , that the spectators were all dumb , until , with a burst , all the lamps of the hall blazed out again , when everybody began to shout applause . `` Brava ! brava ! '' old Steyne 's strident voice was heard roaring over all the rest . `` By -- , she 'd do it too , '' he said between his teeth . The performers were called by the whole house , which sounded with cries of `` Manager ! Clytemnestra ! '' Agamemnon could not be got	1840

'' `` Where you got your step , '' said George with a laugh . `` General Tufto ! Then , my dear , the Crawleys are come . '' Amelia 's heart fell -- she knew not why . The sun did not seem to shine so bright . The tall old roofs and gables looked less picturesque all of a sudden , though it was a brilliant sunset , and one of the brightest and most beautiful days at the end of May . CHAPTER XXIX Brussels Mr. Jos had hired a pair of horses for his open carriage , with	1840

Of what else have young ladies to think , but husbands ? Of what else do their dear mammas think ? `` I must be my own mamma , '' said Rebecca ; not without a tingling consciousness of defeat , as she thought over her little misadventure with Jos Sedley . So she wisely determined to render her position with the Queen 's Crawley family comfortable and secure , and to this end resolved to make friends of every one around her who could at all interfere with her comfort . As my Lady Crawley was not one of these personages , and a woman , moreover , so indolent and void of character as not to be of	1840
her young favourite . `` I 've cares of my own enough , '' Mrs. O'Dowd said , gravely , `` and I thought poor Amelia would be little wanting for company this day . But if she 's so bad as you say , and you ca n't attend to her , who used to be so fond of her , faith I 'll see if I can be of service . And so good marning to ye , Madam '' ; with which speech and a toss of her head , the lady of the repayther took a farewell of Mrs. Crawley , whose company she by no means courted . Becky watched her marching off , with a smile on her lip . She had the keenest sense of humour , and the Parthian look which the retreating Mrs. O'Dowd flung over her	1840
Brompton Lanes flowers grew in profusion under her feet . He called little Georgy Cupid , and asked him news of Venus , his mamma ; and told the astonished Betty Flanagan that she was one of the Graces , and the favourite attendant of the Reine des Amours . Instances might be multiplied of this easily gained and unconscious popularity . Did not Mr. Binny , the mild and genteel curate of the district chapel , which the family attended , call assiduously upon the widow , dandle the little boy on his knee , and offer to teach him Latin , to the anger of the elderly virgin , his sister , who kept house for him ? `` There is nothing in her , Beilby , '' the latter lady	1840
of going -- and that she could serve him with A . The parting was over . Once more poor William walked to the door and was gone ; and the little widow , the author of all this work , had her will , and had won her victory , and was left to enjoy it as she best might . Let the ladies envy her triumph . At the romantic hour of dinner , Mr. Georgy made his appearance and again remarked the absence of `` Old Dob . '' The meal was eaten in silence by the party . Jos 's appetite not being diminished , but Emmy taking nothing at all . After the meal , Georgy was lolling in the cushions of the old window , a large window , with three sides of glass abutting from the gable , and commanding	1840
be a Baronet 's lady . '' Indeed , she rehearsed that exalted part in life with great satisfaction to herself , and to the amusement of old Sir Pitt , who chuckled at her airs and graces , and would laugh by the hour together at her assumptions of dignity and imitations of genteel life . He swore it was as good as a play to see her in the character of a fine dame , and he made her put on one of the first Lady Crawley 's court-dresses , swearing ( entirely to Miss Horrocks ' own concurrence ) that the dress became her prodigiously , and threatening to drive her off that very instant to Court in a coach-and-four	1840
we fear anything beyond a momentary anger ? I think not : I AM SURE not . She dotes upon you so ( you naughty , good-for-nothing man ) , that she would pardon you ANYTHING : and , indeed , I believe , the next place in her heart is mine : and that she would be miserable without me . Dearest ! something TELLS ME we shall conquer . You shall leave that odious regiment : quit gaming , racing , and BE A GOOD BOY ; and we shall all live in Park Lane , and ma tante shall leave us all her money . I shall try and walk to-morrow at 3 in the usual place . If Miss B. accompanies me , you must come to dinner	1840
his pockets , and burst out laughing , as he scrambled into his carriage and four ; he used to burst out laughing at Lady Southdown 's tracts ; and he laughed at his sons , and at the world , and at the Ribbons when she was angry , which was not seldom . Miss Horrocks was installed as housekeeper at Queen 's Crawley , and ruled all the domestics there with great majesty and rigour . All the servants were instructed to address her as `` Mum , '' or `` Madam '' -- and there was one little maid , on her promotion , who persisted in calling her `` My Lady , '' without any rebuke on the part of the housekeeper . `` There	1840
put her shawl -- it was a white cashmere , consigned to her by the Major himself from India -- over her shoulders . He saw there was nothing for it but to obey , and she put her hand into his arm , and they went away . `` It is number 92 , up four pair of stairs , '' Jos said , perhaps not very willing to ascend the steps again ; but he placed himself in the window of his drawing-room , which commands the place on which the Elephant stands , and saw the pair marching through the market . It was as well that Becky saw them too from her garret , for	1840
between us this morning . You all seem to know it . I promise you upon my word that you shall all be paid . He has got a good appointment . Let me go out and find him . '' This audacious statement caused Raggles and the other personages present to look at one another with a wild surprise , and with it Rebecca left them . She went upstairs and dressed herself this time without the aid of her French maid . She went into Rawdon 's room , and there saw that a trunk and bag were packed ready	1840
shawl -- it was a white cashmere , consigned to her by the Major himself from India -- over her shoulders . He saw there was nothing for it but to obey , and she put her hand into his arm , and they went away . `` It is number 92 , up four pair of stairs , '' Jos said , perhaps not very willing to ascend the steps again ; but he placed himself in the window of his drawing-room , which commands the place on which the Elephant stands , and saw the pair marching through the market . It was as well that Becky	1840
the little chap , was Mr. Osborne 's constant saying regarding little Georgy . He saw him in his mind 's eye , a collegian , a Parliament man , a Baronet , perhaps . The old man thought he would die contented if he could see his grandson in a fair way to such honours . He would have none but a tip-top college man to educate him -- none of your quacks and pretenders -- no , no . A few years before , he used to be savage , and inveigh against all parsons , scholars , and the like declaring that they were a pack of humbugs , and quacks that	1840
Ring in Hyde Park or the Congregation at St. James 's -- but which the most squeamish if not the most moral of societies is determined to ignore . In a word , although Colonel Crawley was now five-and-forty years of age , it had not been his lot in life to meet with a half dozen good women , besides his paragon of a wife . All except her and his kind sister Lady Jane , whose gentle nature had tamed and won him , scared the worthy Colonel , and on occasion of his first dinner at Gaunt House he was not heard to make a single remark except to state that the weather was very hot . Indeed Becky would have left him at home , but that virtue ordained that her husband should be by her side to	1840
`` nobs . '' So he forgave young Bullock and consented that the marriage should take place . It was a grand affair -- the bridegroom 's relatives giving the breakfast , their habitations being near St. George 's , Hanover Square , where the business took place . The `` nobs of the West End '' were invited , and many of them signed the book . Mr. Mango and Lady Mary Mango were there , with the dear young Gwendoline and Guinever Mango as bridesmaids ; Colonel Bludyer of the Dragoon Guards ( eldest son of the house of Bludyer Brothers , Mincing Lane ) , another cousin of the bridegroom , and the Honourable Mrs. Bludyer ;	1840
Miss Crawley , be it known , did not leave her room until near noon -- taking chocolate in bed in the morning , while Becky Sharp read the Morning Post to her , or otherwise amusing herself or dawdling . The conspirators below agreed that they would spare the dear lady 's feelings until she appeared in her drawing-room : meanwhile it was announced to her that Mrs. Bute Crawley had come up from Hampshire by the mail , was staying at the Gloster , sent her love to Miss Crawley , and asked for breakfast with Miss Briggs . The arrival of Mrs. Bute , which would not have caused any extreme delight at another period , was hailed with pleasure now ;	1840
from Eton and put into a merchant 's house . Florence Scape , Fanny Scape , and their mother faded away to Boulogne , and will be heard of no more . To be brief , Jos stepped in and bought their carpets and sideboards and admired himself in the mirrors which had reflected their kind handsome faces . The Scape tradesmen , all honourably paid , left their cards , and were eager to supply the new household . The large men in white waistcoats who waited at Scape 's dinners , greengrocers , bank-porters , and milkmen in their private capacity , left their addresses and ingratiated themselves with the butler . Mr. Chummy , the chimney-purifier , who had swept the last three families , tried to coax the butler and the boy under him , whose duty it was to go out covered	1840
Of course you did , '' cried Osborne , still on the laugh . `` One ca n't be ALWAYS thinking about Dobbin , you know , Amelia . Can one , Miss Sharp ? '' `` Except when he overset the glass of wine at dinner , '' Miss Sharp said , with a haughty air and a toss of the head , `` I never gave the existence of Captain Dobbin one single moment 's consideration . '' `` Very good , Miss Sharp , I 'll tell him , '' Osborne said ; and as he spoke Miss Sharp began to have a feeling of distrust and hatred towards this young officer , which he was quite unconscious of having inspired . `` He is to make fun of me , is he ? '' thought Rebecca . `` Has he been laughing about me to	1840
her eyes . `` Oh , Rebecca , how can you -- '' echoed my Lord . `` So that old scoundrel 's dead , is he ? He might have been a Peer if he had played his cards better . Mr. Pitt had very nearly made him ; but he ratted always at the wrong time . What an old Silenus it was ! '' `` I might have been Silenus 's widow , '' said Rebecca . `` Do n't you remember , Miss Briggs , how you peeped in at the door and saw old Sir Pitt on his knees to me ? '' Miss Briggs , our old friend , blushed very much at this reminiscence , and was glad when	1840
, was manager of the revels . An Eastern traveller was somebody in those days , and the adventurous Bedwin , who had published his quarto and passed some months under the tents in the desert , was a personage of no small importance . In his volume there were several pictures of Sands in various oriental costumes ; and he travelled about with a black attendant of most unprepossessing appearance , just like another Brian de Bois Guilbert . Bedwin , his costumes , and black man , were hailed at Gaunt House as very valuable acquisitions . He led off the first charade . A Turkish officer with an immense plume of feathers ( the Janizaries were supposed to be still in existence , and the tarboosh had not as yet displaced the ancient	1840
in silver too , and two footmen , with red hair and canary-coloured liveries , stood on either side of the sideboard . Mr. Crawley said a long grace , and Sir Pitt said amen , and the great silver dish-covers were removed . `` What have we for dinner , Betsy ? '' said the Baronet . `` Mutton broth , I believe , Sir Pitt , '' answered Lady Crawley . `` Mouton aux navets , '' added the butler gravely ( pronounce , if you please , moutongonavvy ) ; `` and the soup is potage de mouton a l'Ecossaise . The side-dishes contain pommes de terre au naturel , and choufleur a l'eau . '' `` Mutton 's mutton , '' said the Baronet , `` and a devilish good	1840
Her first thought was that something had happened to Georgy , but the sight of the messenger 's eager and happy face dissipated that fear in the timorous mother 's bosom . `` News ! News ! '' cried the emissary of Major Dobbin . `` He 's come ! He 's come ! '' `` Who is come ? '' said Emmy , still thinking of her son . `` Look there , '' answered Miss Clapp , turning round and pointing ; in which direction Amelia looking , saw Dobbin 's lean figure and long shadow stalking across the grass . Amelia started in her turn , blushed up , and , of course , began to cry . At all this simple little creature 's fetes , the grandes eaux were accustomed to play . He looked at	1840
employing all the artifices of eloquence , enthusiasm , entreaty , reason , despair ; shouting to his people ; satirizing Mr. Davids for his sluggishness ; inspiriting Mr. Moss into action ; imploring , commanding , bellowing , until down comes the hammer like fate , and we pass to the next lot . O Dives , who would ever have thought , as we sat round the broad table sparkling with plate and spotless linen , to have seen such a dish at the head of it as that roaring auctioneer ? It was rather late in the sale . The excellent drawing-room furniture by the best makers ; the rare and famous wines selected , regardless of cost , and with the well-known taste of the	1840
, dare not face the world without a female friend . They must have somebody to cling to , the affectionate creatures ! And you will hardly see them in any public place without a shabby companion in a dyed silk , sitting somewhere in the shade close behind them . `` Rawdon , '' said Becky , very late one night , as a party of gentlemen were seated round her crackling drawing-room fire ( for the men came to her house to finish the night ; and she had ice and coffee for them , the best in London ) : `` I must have a sheep-dog	1840
a horse for you -- never mind at what price -- and you must dress and come with me , and ride behind Isidor . '' `` God forgive me , Mr. Sedley , but you are no better than a coward , '' Mrs. O'Dowd said , laying down the book . `` I say come , Amelia , '' the civilian went on ; `` never mind what she says ; why are we to stop here and be butchered by the Frenchmen ? '' `` You forget the -- th , my boy , '' said the little Stubble , the wounded hero , from his bed -- '' and and you wo n't leave me , will you , Mrs . O'Dowd ? '' `` No , my dear fellow , '' said she , going up and kissing the boy . `` No	1840
bad spelling . Ah ! there were many anxious hearts beating through England at that time ; and mothers ' prayers and tears flowing in many homesteads . Seeing young Stubble engaged in composition at one of the coffee-room tables at the Slaughters ' , and the tears trickling down his nose on to the paper ( for the youngster was thinking of his mamma , and that he might never see her again ) , Dobbin , who was going to write off a letter to George Osborne , relented , and locked up his desk . `` Why should I ? '' said he . `` Let her have this night happy . I 'll go and see my parents early in the morning , and go down to Brighton myself to-morrow . '' So he went up and laid his big hand on young Stubble 's shoulder	1840
An Eastern traveller was somebody in those days , and the adventurous Bedwin , who had published his quarto and passed some months under the tents in the desert , was a personage of no small importance . In his volume there were several pictures of Sands in various oriental costumes ; and he travelled about with a black attendant of most unprepossessing appearance , just like another Brian de Bois Guilbert . Bedwin , his costumes , and black man , were hailed at Gaunt House as very valuable acquisitions . He led off the first charade . A Turkish officer with an immense plume of feathers ( the Janizaries were supposed to be still in existence , and the tarboosh had not as yet displaced the ancient and majestic head-dress of the true believers ) was seen couched on a divan , and	1840
candle , and to gather up before sunrise the boots which are awaiting him in the passages -- that stair , up or down which babies are carried , old people are helped , guests are marshalled to the ball , the parson walks to the christening , the doctor to the sick-room , and the undertaker 's men to the upper floor -- what a memento of Life , Death , and Vanity it is -- that arch and stair -- if you choose to consider it , and sit on the landing , looking up and down the well ! The doctor will come up to us too for the last time there , my friend in motley . The nurse will look in	1840
a conversation befitting the day and their time of life : about the next pigeon-match at Battersea , with relative bets upon Ross and Osbaldiston ; about Mademoiselle Ariane of the French Opera , and who had left her , and how she was consoled by Panther Carr ; and about the fight between the Butcher and the Pet , and the probabilities that it was a cross . Young Tandyman , a hero of seventeen , laboriously endeavouring to get up a pair of mustachios , had seen the fight , and spoke in the most scientific manner about the battle and the condition of the men . It was he who had driven the Butcher on to the ground in his drag and passed the whole of the previous night with him . Had	1840
haughty as the killing curtsey with which the little woman chose to bid him farewell . He being gone , Emmy was particularly lively and affectionate to Rebecca , and bustled about the apartments and installed her guest in her room with an eagerness and activity seldom exhibited by our placid little friend . But when an act of injustice is to be done , especially by weak people , it is best that it should be done quickly , and Emmy thought she was displaying a great deal of firmness and proper feeling and veneration for the late Captain Osborne in her present behaviour . Georgy came in from the fetes for dinner-time and found four covers laid as usual ; but one of the places was occupied by a lady , instead of by Major Dobbin	1840

'' said Barbara , who was biting her nails , and drumming the table . `` I say , why not send Jim over to Brighton to see if he can do anything with the old lady . He 's very near getting his degree , you know . He 's only been plucked twice -- so was I -- but he 's had the advantages of Oxford and a university education . He knows some of the best chaps there . He pulls stroke in the Boniface boat . He 's a handsome feller . D -- -- it , ma'am , let 's put him on the old woman , hey , and	1840
by telling her that George would go on playing . `` It is curious , when a man is bent upon play , by what clumsy rogues he will allow himself to be cheated , '' Dobbin said ; and Emmy said , `` Indeed . '' She was thinking of something else . It was not the loss of the money that grieved her . At last George came back for Rebecca 's shawl and flowers . She was going away . She did not even condescend to come back and say good-bye to Amelia . The poor girl let her husband come and go without saying a word , and her head fell on her breast . Dobbin had been called	1840
her native country . She favoured her friends with these and other opinions in a very loud tone of voice , and tossed about a great clattering fan she sported , with the most splendid complacency . `` Who is that wonderful woman with Amelia , Rawdon , love ? '' said a lady in an opposite box ( who , almost always civil to her husband in private , was more fond than ever of him in company ) . `` Do n't you see that creature with a yellow thing in her turban , and a red satin gown , and a great watch ? '' `` Near the pretty	1840
to listen at the parlour door , found Loll Jewab shaking upon the hall-bench under the coats , moaning in a strange piteous way , and showing his yellow eyeballs and white teeth . For , you see , we have adroitly shut the door upon the meeting between Jos and the old father and the poor little gentle sister inside . The old man was very much affected ; so , of course , was his daughter ; nor was Jos without feeling . In that long absence of ten years , the most selfish will think about home and early	1840
saying that he would pay for it out of his own money and that he wanted to give it to his mother . The pleased painter executed it for a small price , and old Osborne himself , when he heard of the incident , growled out his satisfaction and gave the boy twice as many sovereigns as he paid for the miniature . But what was the grandfather 's pleasure compared to Amelia 's ecstacy ? That proof of the boy 's affection charmed her so that she thought no child in the world was like hers for goodness . For long weeks after , the thought of his love made her happy . She slept better with the picture under her pillow , and how	1840
and twinkle peacefully in the villages under the hills on the opposite shore . So Jos used to go to sleep a good deal with his bandanna over his face and be very comfortable , and read all the English news , and every word of Galignani 's admirable newspaper ( may the blessings of all Englishmen who have ever been abroad rest on the founders and proprietors of that piratical print ! ) and whether he woke or slept , his friends did not very much miss him . Yes , they were very happy . They went to the opera often of evenings -- to those snug , unassuming , dear old operas in the German towns , where the noblesse sits and cries , and knits stockings on the one side , over against the bourgeoisie on the other ; and His Transparency the	1840
obdurate heart . `` O Sir Pitt , dear Sir Pitt , do not think me ungrateful for all your goodness to me . It is only your generosity that has extorted my secret . '' `` Generosity be hanged ! '' Sir Pitt roared out . `` Who is it tu , then , you 're married ? Where was it ? '' `` Let me come back with you to the country , sir ! Let me watch over you as faithfully as ever ! Do n't , do n't separate me from dear Queen 's Crawley ! '' `` The feller has left you , has he ? '' the Baronet said , beginning , as he fancied , to comprehend . `` Well ,	1840
dignified otiosity such as became a person of his eminence . His very first point , of course , was to become a member of the Oriental Club , where he spent his mornings in the company of his brother Indians , where he dined , or whence he brought home men to dine . Amelia had to receive and entertain these gentlemen and their ladies . From these she heard how soon Smith would be in Council ; how many lacs Jones had brought home with him , how Thomson 's House in London had refused the bills drawn by Thomson , Kibobjee , and Co. , the	1840
the most innocent of them . Pray , madam , shall I tell you some little anecdotes about my Lady Bareacres , your mamma ? '' `` You may strike me if you like , sir , or hit any cruel blow , '' Lady Gaunt said . To see his wife and daughter suffering always put his Lordship into a good humour . `` My sweet Blanche , '' he said , `` I am a gentleman , and never lay my hand upon a woman , save in the way of kindness . I only wish to correct little faults in your character . You women are too proud	1840
most distinguished houses of the restored French nobility . The English men of fashion in Paris courted her , too , to the disgust of the ladies their wives , who could not bear the parvenue . For some months the salons of the Faubourg St. Germain , in which her place was secured , and the splendours of the new Court , where she was received with much distinction , delighted and perhaps a little intoxicated Mrs. Crawley , who may have been disposed during this period of elation to slight the people -- honest young military men mostly -- who	1840
marry her ! '' Dobbin said , blushing very much , and talking quick . `` If you are so ready , young ladies , to chop and change , do you suppose that she is ? Laugh and sneer at that angel . She ca n't hear it ; and she 's miserable and unfortunate , and deserves to be laughed at . Go on joking , Ann . You 're the wit of the family , and the others like to hear it . '' `` I must tell you again we 're not in a barrack , William , '' Miss Ann remarked . `` In a barrack , by Jove -- I wish anybody in a barrack would say	1840
arm-chair in the drawing-room , and the preliminary embraces and inquiries had taken place between the ladies , that the conspirators thought it advisable to submit her to the operation . Who has not admired the artifices and delicate approaches with which women `` prepare '' their friends for bad news ? Miss Crawley 's two friends made such an apparatus of mystery before they broke the intelligence to her , that they worked her up to the necessary degree of doubt and alarm . `` And she refused Sir Pitt , my dear , dear Miss Crawley , prepare yourself for it , '' Mrs. Bute said , `` because -- because she could n't help herself . '' `` Of course there was a reason , '' Miss Crawley answered . `` She liked somebody else . I	1840

Steyne wore the scar to his dying day . `` Come upstairs , '' Rawdon said to his wife . `` Do n't kill me , Rawdon , '' she said . He laughed savagely . `` I want to see if that man lies about the money as he has about me . Has he given you any ? '' `` No , '' said Rebecca , `` that is -- '' `` Give me your keys , '' Rawdon answered , and they went out together . Rebecca gave him all the keys but one ,	1840
pack of cards . We had but one candle lighted , but it was in a magnificent old silver candlestick , and after a very few questions from my lady , I had my choice of amusement between a volume of sermons , and a pamphlet on the corn-laws , which Mr. Crawley had been reading before dinner . So we sat for an hour until steps were heard . `` Put away the cards , girls , '' cried my lady , in a great tremor ; `` put down Mr. Crawley 's books , Miss Sharp '' ; and these orders had	1840
as usual . His present of money , needful as it was , made little impression on his parents ; and I have heard Amelia say that the first day on which she saw her father lift up his head after the failure was on the receipt of the packet of forks and spoons with the young stockbrokers ' love , over which he burst out crying like a child , being greatly more affected than even his wife , to whom the present was addressed . Edward Dale , the junior of the house , who purchased the spoons for the firm , was , in fact , very sweet upon Amelia , and offered for her in spite of all . He married Miss	1840
and confidence , sicken and rebuke you ! What a dreary mourning it is to dwell upon those vehement protests of dead affection ! What lying epitaphs they make over the corpse of love ! What dark , cruel comments upon Life and Vanities ! Most of us have got or written drawers full of them . They are closet-skeletons which we keep and shun . Osborne trembled long before the letter from his dead son . The poor boy 's letter did not say much . He had been too proud to acknowledge the tenderness which his heart felt . He only said , that on the eve of a	1840
door ? No ; it was stealthily opened by the hand of Briggs . Briggs had been on the watch . Briggs too well heard the creaking Firkin descend the stairs , and the clink of the spoon and gruel-basin the neglected female carried . `` Well , Firkin ? '' says she , as the other entered the apartment . `` Well , Jane ? '' `` Wuss and wuss , Miss B. , '' Firkin said , wagging her head . `` Is she not better then ? '' `` She never spoke but once , and I asked her if she felt a little more easy , and she told me to hold my stupid tongue . Oh , Miss B. , I never	1840

My darling Frederick must positively be an eldest son ; and -- and do ask Papa to bring us back his account in Lombard Street , will you , dear ?

She could not bear the reproaches of the husband there before her . It could n't be . Never , never . Poor Dobbin ; poor old William ! That unlucky word had undone the work of many a year -- the long laborious edifice of a life of love and constancy -- raised too upon what secret and hidden foundations , wherein lay buried passions , uncounted struggles , unknown sacrifices -- a little word was spoken , and down fell the fair palace of hope -- one word , and away flew the bird which he had been trying all his life to lure ! William , though he saw by	1840
with an acquaintance , Captain Walker , who happened to be there , and with whom he cut for sixpences for some hours , with pretty equal luck on either side . But the day passed away and no messenger returned -- no Becky . Mr. Moss 's tably-dy-hoty was served at the appointed hour of half-past five , when such of the gentlemen lodging in the house as could afford to pay for the banquet came and partook of it in the splendid front parlour before described , and with which Mr. Crawley 's temporary lodging communicated , when Miss	1840
-- Mrs. Frederick Bullock would gather her starched nurslings and simper back into her carriage . Every visit which this leader of ton paid to her family was more unlucky for her . Her father paid more money into Stumpy and Rowdy 's . Her patronage became more and more insufferable . The poor widow in the little cottage at Brompton , guarding her treasure there , little knew how eagerly some people coveted it . On that night when Jane Osborne had told her father that she had seen his grandson , the old man had made her no reply , but he had shown no anger -- and had bade her good-night on going himself to his room in rather a kindly voice . And he must have meditated on what she said and have made some inquiries of the	1840
Madame de Belladonna made him a scene about you and fired off in one of her furies . '' `` Oh , it was Madame de Belladonna , was it ? '' Becky said , relieved a little , for the information she had just got had scared her . `` No -- she does not matter -- she is always jealous . I tell you it was Monseigneur . You did wrong to show yourself to him . And if you stay here you will repent it . Mark my words . Go . Here is my lord 's carriage '' -- and seizing Becky 's arm , he rushed down an alley of the garden as Lord Steyne 's barouche , blazing with heraldic devices , came whirling along the avenue , borne by the almost priceless horses , and bearing Madame de Belladonna	1840
put the note up in an envelope for Lord Steyne . My man sha n't fight him . But we had rather not take his money . '' `` It was all a mistake -- all a mistake , my dear sir , '' the other said with the utmost innocence of manner ; and was bowed down the Club steps by Captain Macmurdo , just as Sir Pitt Crawley ascended them . There was a slight acquaintance between these two gentlemen , and the Captain , going back with the Baronet to the room where the latter 's brother was , told Sir Pitt , in confidence , that he had made the affair all right between Lord Steyne and the Colonel . Sir Pitt was well pleased , of course , at this intelligence , and congratulated his brother warmly	1840
attendant , poor Mrs. Osborne put on her cloaks and her shawls preparatory to walking home . As for the learning which Georgy imbibed under this valuable master of a hundred sciences , to judge from the weekly reports which the lad took home to his grandfather , his progress was remarkable . The names of a score or more of desirable branches of knowledge were printed in a table , and the pupil 's progress in each was marked by the professor . In Greek Georgy was pronounced aristos , in Latin optimus , in French tres bien , and so forth ; and everybody had prizes for everything at the end of the year . Even Mr. Swartz , the	1840
her beauty , and the gentleman `` with hay-coloured whiskers and straw-coloured hair , '' are very smart , doubtless , and show a great knowledge of the world . That she might , when on her knees , have been thinking of something better than Miss Horrocks 's ribbons , has possibly struck both of us . But my kind reader will please to remember that this history has `` Vanity Fair '' for a title , and that Vanity Fair is a very vain , wicked , foolish place , full of all sorts of humbugs and falsenesses and pretensions .

How her heart beat as Joseph appeared -- Joseph , puffing from the staircase in shining creaking boots -- Joseph , in a new waistcoat , red with heat and nervousness , and blushing behind his wadded neckcloth . It was a nervous moment for all ; and as for Amelia , I think she was more frightened than even the people most concerned . Sambo , who flung open the door and announced Mr. Joseph , followed grinning , in the Collector 's rear , and bearing two handsome nosegays of flowers , which the monster had actually had the gallantry to purchase in Covent	1840
( then newly imported ) at the great carved-legged , leather-cased grand piano in the drawing-room overhead . This little artifice did not bring him . He was deaf to the waltzes ; they grew fainter and fainter ; the discomfited performer left the huge instrument presently ; and though her three friends performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new pieces of their repertoire , she did not hear a single note , but sate thinking , and boding evil . Old Osborne 's scowl , terrific always , had never before looked so deadly to her . His eyes followed her out of the room ,	1840
epaulets had been stowed into a tea canister , whilst her own famous yellow turban , with the bird of paradise wrapped in brown paper , was locked up in the Major 's tin cocked-hat case , and wondered what effect it would have at the French king 's court at Ghent , or the great military balls at Brussels . `` Ghent ! Brussels ! '' cried out Amelia with a sudden shock and start . `` Is the regiment ordered away , George -- is it ordered away ? '' A look of terror came over the sweet smiling face , and she clung to George as by an instinct . `` Do n't be afraid , dear , '' he said good-naturedly ; `` it is but a twelve hours ' passage . It wo n't hurt you . You shall go , too , Emmy .	1840
Upon my word , I thought when we were at Brighton she was doing me the honour to be jealous of me ; and now I suppose she is scandalised because Rawdon , and I , and the General live together . Why , my dear creature , how could we , with our means , live at all , but for a friend to share expenses ? And do you suppose that Rawdon is not big enough to take care of my honour ? But I 'm very much obliged to Emmy , very , '' Mrs. Rawdon said . `` Pooh , jealousy ! '' answered George , `` all women are jealous . '' `` And all men too . Were n't you jealous of General Tufto , and the General of you	1840
George 's sitting-room windows , and shine out in the bedroom close at hand . It was almost morning when he returned to his own quarters . He could hear the cheering from the ships in the river , where the transports were already taking in their cargoes preparatory to dropping down the Thames . CHAPTER XXVIII In Which Amelia Invades the Low Countries The regiment with its officers was to be transported in ships provided by His Majesty 's government for the occasion : and in two days after the festive assembly at Mrs. O'Dowd 's apartments , in the midst of cheering from all the East India ships in the river , and the military	1840
's not money I want , '' Rawdon broke in . `` I 'm not come to you about myself . Never mind what happens to me . '' `` What is the matter , then ? '' said Pitt , somewhat relieved . `` It 's the boy , '' said Rawdon in a husky voice . `` I want you to promise me that you will take charge of him when I 'm gone . That dear good wife of yours has always been good to him ; and he 's fonder of her than he is of his . . . -- Damn it . Look here , Pitt -- you know that I was to have had Miss Crawley 's money . I was n't brought up like a younger brother , but was always encouraged to be extravagant and kep idle . But for	1840
, and an attempt was made to force from Madame de Belladonna the celebrated jewel called the `` Jew's-eye '' diamond , which his lordship always wore on his forefinger , and which it was said that she removed from it after his lamented demise . But his confidential friend and attendant , Monsieur Fiche proved that the ring had been presented to the said Madame de Belladonna two days before the Marquis 's death , as were the bank-notes , jewels , Neapolitan and French bonds , & c. , found in his lordship 's secretaire and claimed by his heirs from that injured woman . CHAPTER LXV Full of Business and Pleasure The day after the meeting at the play-table , Jos had himself arrayed with unusual care and splendour , and without thinking it necessary to say a word	1840
. Jos begged the Colonel to come and see him that night , when Mrs. Crawley would be at a soiree , and when they could meet alone . He found his brother-in-law in a condition of pitiable infirmity -- and dreadfully afraid of Rebecca , though eager in his praises of her . She tended him through a series of unheard-of illnesses with a fidelity most admirable . She had been a daughter to him . `` But -- but -- oh , for God 's sake , do come and live near me , and -- and -- see me sometimes , '' whimpered out the unfortunate man . The Colonel 's brow darkened at this . `` We ca n't , Jos , '' he said . `` Considering	1840
. He smokes his hookah after both meals and puffs as quietly while his wife scolds him as he did under the fire of the French at Waterloo . Age and heat have not diminished the activity or the eloquence of the descendant of the Malonys and the Molloys . Her Ladyship , our old acquaintance , is as much at home at Madras as at Brussels in the cantonment as under the tents . On the march you saw her at the head of the regiment seated on a royal elephant , a noble sight . Mounted on that beast , she has been into action with tigers in the jungle , she has been received	1840
, and who , by those mere aggressive glances had put her timorous little heart into such a flutter that she was ready to surrender at once , -- what she should do if he were to die ? She knew he was consumptive , his cheeks were so red and he was so uncommon thin in the waist . Not that Emmy , being made aware of the honest Major 's passion , rebuffed him in any way , or felt displeased with him . Such an attachment from so true and loyal a gentleman could make no woman angry . Desdemona was not angry with Cassio , though there is very little	1840
and `` Hume and Smollett . '' From year 's end to year 's end he never took one of these volumes from the shelf ; but there was no member of the family that would dare for his life to touch one of the books , except upon those rare Sunday evenings when there was no dinner-party , and when the great scarlet Bible and Prayer-book were taken out from the corner where they stood beside his copy of the Peerage , and the servants being rung up to the dining parlour , Osborne read the evening service to his family in a loud grating pompous voice . No member of the household , child , or domestic , ever entered that room without a certain terror . Here he checked	1840
particulars of the night 's conversation ; the politics ; the war ; the quarter-sessions ; the famous run with the H.H. , and those heavy and dreary themes , about which country gentlemen converse . As for the Misses Wapshot 's toilettes and Lady Fuddleston 's famous yellow hat , Miss Sharp tore them to tatters , to the infinite amusement of her audience . `` My dear , you are a perfect trouvaille , '' Miss Crawley would say . `` I wish you could come to me in London , but I could n't make a butt of	1840
own fancy ; or they are to be let furnished , a less troublesome and complicated arrangement to most parties . It was so that Crawley and his wife preferred to hire their house . Before Mr. Bowls came to preside over Miss Crawley 's house and cellar in Park Lane , that lady had had for a butler a Mr. Raggles , who was born on the family estate of Queen 's Crawley , and indeed was a younger son of a gardener there . By good conduct , a handsome person and calves , and a grave demeanour , Raggles rose from the knife-board to the footboard of the carriage ; from the footboard to the butler 's pantry . When he had been a certain number of years at	1840
smallest actions marked by an infallible grace and wisdom . `` How she sings , -- how she paints , '' thought he . `` How she rode that kicking mare at Queen 's Crawley ! '' And he would say to her in confidential moments , `` By Jove , Beck , you 're fit to be Commander-in-Chief , or Archbishop of Canterbury , by Jove . '' Is his case a rare one ? and do n't we see every day in the world many an honest Hercules at the apron-strings of Omphale , and great whiskered Samsons prostrate in Delilah 's lap ? When , then ,	1840
should spend the proceeds of her shawl -- how , besides the clothes , she would buy the books that he longed for , and pay his half-year 's schooling ; and how she would buy a cloak for her father instead of that old great-coat which he wore . She was not mistaken as to the value of the Major 's gift . It was a very fine and beautiful web , and the merchant made a very good bargain when he gave her twenty guineas for her shawl . She ran on amazed and flurried with her riches to Darton 's shop , in St. Paul 's Churchyard , and there purchased the Parents ' Assistant and the Sandford and Merton Georgy longed for , and got into the coach there with her parcel , and went home exulting . And she pleased herself by writing in	1840
with her maid and her furs , her wrappers , and her scent bottles , made such a to-do that you would have thought she never had been in a stage-coach before -- much less , that she had been turned out of this very one to make room for a paying passenger on a certain journey performed some half-score years ago . It was dark again when little Rawdon was wakened up to enter his uncle 's carriage at Mudbury , and he sat and looked out of it wondering as the great iron gates flew open , and at the white	1840
is it tu , then , you 're married ? Where was it ? '' `` Let me come back with you to the country , sir ! Let me watch over you as faithfully as ever ! Do n't , do n't separate me from dear Queen 's Crawley ! '' `` The feller has left you , has he ? '' the Baronet said , beginning , as he fancied , to comprehend . `` Well , Becky -- come back if you like . You ca n't eat your cake and have it . Any ways I made you a vair offer . Coom back as governess -- you shall have it all your own way . '' She held out one hand . She cried fit to break her heart ; her ringlets fell over her face	1840
Osborne to inform you , that he abides by the determination which he before expressed to you , and that in consequence of the marriage which you have been pleased to contract , he ceases to consider you henceforth as a member of his family . This determination is final and irrevocable . `` Although the monies expended upon you in your minority , and the bills which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years , far exceed in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right ( being the third part of the fortune of your mother , the late Mrs. Osborne and which reverted to you at her decease , and to Miss Jane Osborne and Miss	1840
opinions Crawley agreed laughingly , and with every one of which Miss Rebecca was made acquainted before twenty-four hours were over . They added to her original regard for Mr. Osborne . Her woman 's instinct had told her that it was George who had interrupted the success of her first love-passage , and she esteemed him accordingly . `` I only just warn you , '' he said to Rawdon Crawley , with a knowing look -- he had bought the horse , and lost some score of guineas after dinner , `` I just warn you -- I know women , and counsel you to be on the look-out . '' `` Thank you , my boy , '' said Crawley , with a look of peculiar gratitude . `` You 're wide	1840
She had sat up of nights conning lessons and spelling over crabbed grammars and geography books in order to teach them to Georgy . She had worked even at the Latin accidence , fondly hoping that she might be capable of instructing him in that language . To part with him all day , to send him out to the mercy of a schoolmaster 's cane and his schoolfellows ' roughness , was almost like weaning him over again to that weak mother , so tremulous and full of sensibility . He , for his part , rushed off to the school with the utmost happiness	1840
to forget , but I can not . I can not forget old times , monsieur . Your little nephew is the image of his father ; and you -- you are not changed -- but yes , you are . Everybody changes , everybody forgets ; nobody has any heart . '' `` Good God , who is it ? '' asked Jos in a flutter . `` Ca n't you guess , Joseph Sedley ? '' said the little woman in a sad voice , and undoing her mask , she looked at him . `` You have forgotten me . '' `` Good heavens ! Mrs . Crawley ! '' gasped out Jos . `` Rebecca , '' said the other , putting her hand on his ; but she followed the game still , all the time she was looking at	1840
and enthusiasm , which everybody can understand who knows that famous corps . From the colonel to the smallest drummer in the regiment , all were filled with hope and ambition and patriotic fury ; and thanked the French Emperor as for a personal kindness in coming to disturb the peace of Europe . Now was the time the -- th had so long panted for , to show their comrades in arms that they could fight as well as the Peninsular veterans , and that all the pluck and valour of the -- th had not been killed by the West Indies and the yellow fever . Stubble and	1840
her at one of these fairs . She cast down her eyes demurely and smiled as they started away from her ; Emmy scurrying off on the arm of George ( now grown a dashing young gentleman ) and the Colonel seizing up his little Janey , of whom he is fonder than of anything in the world -- fonder even than of his History of the Punjaub . `` Fonder than he is of me , '' Emmy thinks with a sigh . But he never said a word to Amelia that was not kind and gentle , or thought of	1840
modest graces . Poor Swartz was seated in a place where Emmy had been accustomed to sit . Her bejewelled hands lay sprawling in her amber satin lap . Her tags and ear-rings twinkled , and her big eyes rolled about . She was doing nothing with perfect contentment , and thinking herself charming . Anything so becoming as the satin the sisters had never seen . `` Dammy , '' George said to a confidential friend , `` she looked like a China doll , which has nothing to do all day but to grin and wag its head . By Jove , Will , it was all I I could do to prevent myself from throwing the sofa-cushion at her . '' He restrained that exhibition of sentiment , however . The sisters began to play the Battle of Prague . `` Stop that d	1840
Miss Osborne , I say , thought that when he had given himself a little air , he would unbosom himself entirely , and prepared eagerly to listen . And the clock , in the altar on which Iphigenia was situated , beginning , after a preparatory convulsion , to toll twelve , the mere tolling seemed as if it would last until one -- so prolonged was the knell to the anxious spinster . `` But it 's not about marriage that I came to speak -- that is that marriage -- that is -- no , I mean -- my dear Miss Osborne , it 's about our dear friend George , '' Dobbin said . ``	1840
I was married I did n't care what bills I put my name to , and so long as Moses would wait or Levy would renew for three months , I kept on never minding . But since I 'm married , except renewing , of course , I give you my honour I 've not touched a bit of stamped paper . '' Rebecca always knew how to conjure away these moods of melancholy . `` Why , my stupid love , '' she would say , `` we have not done with your aunt yet . If she fails us , is n't there what you call the Gazette ? or , stop , when	1840
, and crying , with the hysterical YOOPS of Miss Swartz , the parlour-boarder , from her room , as no pen can depict , and as the tender heart would fain pass over . The embracing was over ; they parted -- that is , Miss Sedley parted from her friends . Miss Sharp had demurely entered the carriage some minutes before . Nobody cried for leaving HER . Sambo of the bandy legs slammed the carriage door on his young weeping mistress . He sprang up behind the carriage . `` Stop ! '' cried Miss Jemima , rushing to the gate with a parcel . `` It 's some sandwiches , my dear , '' said she to Amelia . `` You	1840
whose high presence Mrs. Rawdon passed her examination , and as it were , took her degree in reputation , it surely must be flat disloyalty to doubt any more about her virtue . I , for my part , look back with love and awe to that Great Character in history . Ah , what a high and noble appreciation of Gentlewomanhood there must have been in Vanity Fair , when that revered and august being was invested , by the universal acclaim of the refined and educated portion of this empire , with the title of Premier Gentilhomme of his Kingdom . Do you remember , dear	1840
. What do men know about women 's martyrdoms ? We should go mad had we to endure the hundredth part of those daily pains which are meekly borne by many women . Ceaseless slavery meeting with no reward ; constant gentleness and kindness met by cruelty as constant ; love , labour , patience , watchfulness , without even so much as the acknowledgement of a good word ; all this , how many of them have to bear in quiet , and appear abroad with cheerful faces as if they felt nothing . Tender slaves that they are , they must needs be hypocrites and weak . From her chair Amelia 's mother had taken to her bed , which she had never left ,	1840
'' `` Give him no quarter . Bring back the villain 's head , sir . Shoot the coward down , sir , '' Sedley roared . `` I 'd enlist myself , by -- ; but I 'm a broken old man -- ruined by that damned scoundrel -- and by a parcel of swindling thieves in this country whom I made , sir , and who are rolling in their carriages now , '' he added , with a break in his voice . Dobbin was not a little affected by the sight of this once kind old friend , crazed almost with misfortune and raving with senile anger . Pity the fallen gentleman : you to whom money and fair repute are the chiefest good ; and so , surely , are they in Vanity Fair . `` Yes , ''	1840
ten thousand miles to the military station of Bundlegunge , in the Madras division of our Indian empire , where our gallant old friends of the -- th regiment are quartered under the command of the brave Colonel , Sir Michael O'Dowd . Time has dealt kindly with that stout officer , as it does ordinarily with men who have good stomachs and good tempers and are not perplexed over much by fatigue of the brain . The Colonel plays a good knife and fork at tiffin and resumes those weapons with great success at dinner . He smokes his hookah after both meals and puffs as quietly while his wife scolds him as he did under the	1840
a gold enamelled snuff-box which had once belonged to Madame du Barri , and the sweetest little inkstand and mother-of-pearl blotting book , which Becky used when she composed her charming little pink notes , had vanished from the premises in Curzon Street together with Mademoiselle Fifine , and all the silver laid on the table for the little festin which Rawdon interrupted . The plated ware Mademoiselle left behind her was too cumbrous , probably for which reason , no doubt , she also left the fire irons , the chimney-glasses , and the rosewood cottage piano . A lady very like her subsequently kept a milliner 's shop in the Rue du Helder at Paris , where she lived with great credit and enjoyed the patronage of my Lord Steyne . This	1840
thought his diamond shirt-pin ( which she had not known him to wear before ) the prettiest ornament ever seen . The observant reader , who has marked our young Lieutenant 's previous behaviour , and has preserved our report of the brief conversation which he has just had with Captain Dobbin , has possibly come to certain conclusions regarding the character of Mr. Osborne . Some cynical Frenchman has said that there are two parties to a love-transaction : the one who loves and the other who condescends to be so treated . Perhaps the love is occasionally on the man 's side ; perhaps on the lady 's . Perhaps some infatuated swain has ere this mistaken insensibility for modesty , dulness for maiden reserve , mere vacuity for sweet bashfulness , and a goose , in a word , for a swan . Perhaps some beloved female	1840
jovial , snug appearance not visible at other seasons . You yourself , dear sir , forget to go to sleep after dinner , and find yourself all of a sudden ( though you invariably lose ) very fond of a rubber . What good dinners you have -- game every day , Malmsey-Madeira , and no end of fish from London . Even the servants in the kitchen share in the general prosperity ; and , somehow , during the stay of Miss MacWhirter 's fat coachman , the beer is grown much stronger , and the consumption of tea and sugar in the nursery ( where her maid takes her meals ) is not regarded in the least . Is it so , or is it not so ? I appeal to the middle	1840
of birth , and felt it her duty to see her father and sister as little as possible . That she should utterly break with the old man , who had still so many scores of thousand pounds to give away , is absurd to suppose . Fred Bullock would never allow her to do that . But she was still young and incapable of hiding her feelings ; and by inviting her papa and sister to her third-rate parties , and behaving very coldly to them when they came , and by avoiding Russell Square , and indiscreetly begging her father to quit that odious vulgar place , she did more harm than all Frederick 's diplomacy could repair , and perilled	1840
carps at her for her efforts at kindness or service ; rails at her for her silly pride in her child and her neglect of her parents . Georgy 's house is not a very lively one since Uncle Jos 's annuity has been withdrawn and the little family are almost upon famine diet . Amelia thinks , and thinks , and racks her brain , to find some means of increasing the small pittance upon which the household is starving . Can she give lessons in anything ? paint card-racks ? do fine work ? She finds that women are working hard , and better than she can , for twopence a day . She buys a couple of begilt Bristol boards at the Fancy Stationer 's and paints	1840
before his employer a perfectly guilty and trembling , though harmless , wretch . `` How dare you , sir , break it ? '' says Cuff ; `` you blundering little thief . You drank the shrub , and now you pretend to have broken the bottle . Hold out your hand , sir . '' Down came the stump with a great heavy thump on the child 's hand . A moan followed . Dobbin looked up . The Fairy Peribanou had fled into the inmost cavern with Prince Ahmed : the Roc had whisked away Sindbad the Sailor out	1840
Doctor 's house there . And in another hour ( by which fact we ascertain how carefully the excellent Mrs. Bute Crawley had always kept up an understanding with the great house ) , that lady in her clogs and calash , the Reverend Bute Crawley , and James Crawley , her son , had walked over from the Rectory through the park , and had entered the mansion by the open hall-door . They passed through the hall and the small oak parlour , on the table of which stood the three tumblers and the empty rum-bottle which had served for Sir Pitt 's carouse , and through that apartment into Sir Pitt 's study , where they found Miss Horrocks , of	1840
was gazing from the window , she startled Miss Crawley , who was placidly occupied with a French novel , by crying out in an alarmed tone , `` Here 's Sir Pitt , Ma'am ! '' and the Baronet 's knock followed this announcement . `` My dear , I ca n't see him . I wo n't see him . Tell Bowls not at home , or go downstairs and say I 'm too ill to receive any one . My nerves really wo n't bear my brother at this moment , '' cried out Miss Crawley , and resumed the novel . `` She 's too ill to see you , sir , '' Rebecca said , tripping down to Sir Pitt , who was preparing to ascend . `` So	1840
head and bowing time over her . Rawdon and his friend meanwhile played ecarte until they had enough . The Colonel won ; but , say that he won ever so much and often , nights like these , which occurred many times in the week -- his wife having all the talk and all the admiration , and he sitting silent without the circle , not comprehending a word of the jokes , the allusions , the mystical language within -- must have been rather wearisome to the ex-dragoon . `` How is Mrs. Crawley 's husband ? '' Lord Steyne used to say to him by way of	1840
housekeeper ’ s room . Mr. Macallan ’ s valet had ordered the tea for his mistress by his master ’ s directions . The under-housemaid made it , and took it upstairs herself to Mrs. Macallan ’ s room . Her master , she said , opened the door when she knocked , and took the tea-cup from her with his own hand . He opened the door widely enough for her to see into the bedroom , and to notice that nobody was with Mrs. Macallan but himself . “ After a little talk with the under-housemaid , I returned to the bedroom . No one was there .	1870
said to justify it , gratuitously accuses his visitor of suspecting somebody . Query here : When a small sum of money is missing in a household , and the servants in general are called together to be informed of the circumstance , what do we think of the one servant in particular who speaks first , and who says , ‘ Do you suspect _me ? _ ’ ” He laid down the pen again . “ Is that right ? ” he asked . I began to see the end to which the notes were drifting . Instead of answering his question , I entreated him to enter into the explanations that were still	1870
land and sea -- the tiger , the rhinoceros , the crocodile , the sea-serpent , the shark , and the devil-fish -- surrounded the accursed Wanderer in a mystic circle , daunted and fascinated at the sight of him . The lightning was gone . The sky and sea had darkened to a great black blank . A faint and lurid light lighted the scene , falling downward from a torch , brandished by an avenging Spirit that hovered over the Jew on outspread vulture wings . Wild as the picture might be in its conception , there was a suggestive power in it which I confess strongly impressed me . The mysterious silence in the house , and my strange position at the moment , no doubt had their effect on my mind . While I was still looking	1870
all that carted away out of sight , ” said the lawyer . “ We don ’ t mind in Scotland , as long as the dust-heap is far enough away not to be smelt at the house . Besides , some of it , sifted , comes in usefully as manure for the garden . Here the place is deserted , and the rubbish in consequence has not been disturbed . Everything at Gleninch , Mrs. Eustace ( the big dust-heap included ) , is waiting for the new mistress to set it to rights . One of these days you may be queen here -- who knows ? ” “ I shall never see this place again , ” I said . “ Never is a long day ,	1870
On the twentieth of October , at eleven o ’ clock in the forenoon , I was sent to work in the shrubbery , on the side next to the garden called the Dutch Garden . There was a summer-house in the Dutch Garden , having its back set toward the shrubbery . The day was wonderfully fine and -- warm for the time of year . “ Passing to my work , I passed the back of the summer-house . I heard voices inside -- a man ’ s voice and a lady ’ s voice . The lady ’ s voice was strange to me . The man ’ s voice I recognized as the voice of my master .	1870
listened -- oh ! with such a heavy heart , with such a crushing sense of disenchantment and despair ! The idol of my worship , the companion , guide , protector of my life -- had he fallen so low ? could he stoop to such shameless prevarication as this ? Was there one word of truth in all that he had said to me ? Yes ! If I had not discovered his mother ’ s portrait , it was certainly true that I should not have known , not even have vaguely suspected , who she really was . Apart from this , the rest was lying , clumsy lying , which said one thing at least for him , that he was not accustomed to falsehood and deceit . Good Heavens ! if my	1870
-- ruffling , worrying things , like flies in summer -- which he was putting away from him . “ What else have you discovered ? ” he asked , in low , stern tones . “ Nothing , Eustace. ” “ Nothing ? ” He paused as he repeated the word , and passed his hand over his forehead in a weary way . “ Nothing , of course , ” he resumed , speaking to himself , “ or she would not be here. ” He paused once more , and looked at me searchingly . “ Don ’ t say again what	1870
Time , evening . The owls are hooting in the wood ; the frogs are croaking in the marsh. -- Look at Ariel ! Her flesh creeps ; she shudders audibly . Admirable Ariel ! ” My rival in the Master ’ s favor eyed me defiantly . “ Admirable Ariel ! ” she repeated , in drowsy accents . Miserrimus Dexter paused to take up his goblet of Burgundy -- placed close at hand on a little sliding table attached to his chair . I watched him narrowly as he sipped the wine . The flush was still mounting in his face ; the light was still brightening in his eyes . He set down his glass again , with a jovial smack of his lips	1870
. “ Drop it , or I shall instantly leave you. ” Miserrimus Dexter ’ s delicate nerves shuddered at my violence . “ What a glorious voice ! ” he exclaimed -- and dropped the string . “ Take the cakes , ” he added , addressing Ariel in his most imperial manner . She passed me , with the strings hanging from her swollen wrists , and the dish of cakes in her hand . She nodded her head at me defiantly . “ Ariel has got no nerves , ” she repeated , proudly . “ He doesn ’ t hurt me. ” “ You see , ” said Miserrimus Dexter ,	1870
was quiet and polite again when he next spoke to me . “ Very well . Pardon me for a moment if I absorb myself in my own thoughts . I want to do something which I have not done yet. ” “ What may that be , Mr. Dexter ? ” “ I am going to put myself into Mrs. Beauly ’ s skin , and to think with Mrs. Beauly ’ s mind . Give me a minute . Thank you. ” What did he mean ? what new transformation of him was passing before my eyes ? Was there ever such a puzzle of a man as this ? Who that saw him now , intently pursuing his new train of thought , would have recognized him as the childish creature who had awoke so innocently , and had astonished Benjamin by the infantine nonsense which he	1870

If this is not enough to kill me , I have more left in the bottle . “ Ten minutes past five . “ You have just gone , after giving me my composing draught . My courage failed me at the sight of you .

I do not scruple to say that I never read anything so infamous as this great lawyer ’ s speech . He was not ashamed to declare , at starting , that he firmly believed the prisoner to be guilty . What right had he to say anything of the sort ? Was it for _him_ to decide ? Was he the Judge and Jury both , I should like to know ? Having begun by condemning the prisoner on his own authority , the Lord Advocate proceeded to pervert the most innocent actions of that unhappy man so	1870

He threw it to me where I sat , and burst into a passion of tears . A man in my place might have known what to do . Being only a woman , I yielded to the compassionate impulse of the moment . I got up and crossed the room to him . I gave him back his locket , and put my hand , without knowing what I was about , on the poor wretch ’ s shoulder . “ I am incapable of suspecting you , Mr. Dexter , ” I said ,	1870
the open window of my room . In five minutes more I had accepted the invitation of the bed , and had said farewell to my anxieties and my troubles . In five minutes more I was fast asleep . A discreetly gentle knock at my door was the first sound that aroused me . I heard the voice of my good old Benjamin speaking outside . “ My dear ! I am afraid you will be starved if I let you sleep any longer . It is half-past one o ’ clock ; and a friend of yours has come to lunch with us. ” A friend of mine ? What friends had I ? My husband was far away ; and my uncle Starkweather had given me up in despair . “ Who is it ? ” I cried out from my bed , through the	1870

Would you please tell Mr. Macallan , and send for the doctor ? ’ She ran downstairs at once to do as I told her . “ I had not been long back at the bedside when Mr. Macallan and Mrs. Beauly both came in together . Mrs. Macallan cast a strange look on them ( a look I can not at all describe ) , and bade them leave her . Mrs. Beauly , looking very much frightened , withdrew immediately . Mr. Macallan advanced a step or two nearer to the bed . His wife looked at him again in the same strange way , and cried out -- half as if she was threatening him , half as if she was entreating him -- ‘ Leave me with the nurse . Go	1870
or later , with or without assistance , I shall find it . Yes ! before I know any single particular of the Case , I tell you positively -- I shall find it ! “ You may laugh over this blind confidence on my part , or you may cry over it . I don ’ t pretend to know whether I am an object for ridicule or an object for pity . Of one thing only I am certain : I mean to win you back , a man vindicated before the world , without a stain on his character or his name -- thanks to his wife . “ Write to me , sometimes , Eustace ; and believe me ,	1870
as being an unusually handsome man . A painter would have reveled in him as a model for St. John . And a young girl , ignorant of what the Oriental robe hid from view , would have said to herself , the instant she looked at him , “ Here is the hero of my dreams ! ” His blue eyes -- large as the eyes of a woman , clear as the eyes of a child -- rested on me the moment I turned toward him , with a strangely varying play of expression , which at once interested and perplexed me . Now there was doubt -- uneasy , painful doubt -- in the	1870
! God bless you ! Good-by. ” So he said his farewell words , at the door of the hotel . Kind , genial , clever -- but oh , how easily prejudiced , how shockingly obstinate in holding to his own opinion ! And _what_ an opinion ! I shuddered as I thought of it . CHAPTER XXXV . MR. PLAYMORE ’ S PROPHECY . WE reached London between eight and nine in the evening . Strictly methodical in all his habits , Benjamin had telegraphed to his housekeeper , from Edinburgh , to have supper ready or us by ten o ’ clock , and to send the cabman whom he always employed to meet us at the station . Arriving at	1870
corner and approached the sofa . “ I suppose I had better go too ? ” she said , addressing Major Fitz-David . “ If you please , ” the Major answered . He spoke ( as I thought ) rather coldly . She tossed her head , and turned her back on him in high indignation . “ I must say a word for myself ! ” cried this strange creature , with a hysterical outbreak of energy . “ I must say a word , or I shall burst ! ” With that extraordinary preface , she suddenly turned my way and poured out a perfect torrent of words on me . “	1870
as far as the stable wall . My husband was alone in the room , seated at the further end of it , near the fire-place . He started to his feet and faced me in silence as I entered . The Major softly closed the door on us and retired . Eustace never stirred a step to meet me . I ran to him , and threw my arms round his neck and kissed him . The embrace was not returned ; the kiss was not returned . He passively submitted -- nothing more . “ Eustace ! ” I said , “ I never loved you more dearly than I love you at this moment ! I never felt for	1870
-- I am . And I want to know what it means. ” She advanced a few steps nearer to me , with a heightening color and a threatening look . “ Is he going to bring _you_ out on the stage ? ” she asked , sharply . “ Certainly not. ” “ He ain ’ t in love with you , is he ? ” Under other circumstances I might have told her to leave the room . In my position at that critical moment the mere presence of a human creature was a positive relief to me . Even this girl , with her coarse questions and her uncultivated manners , was a welcome intruder on my solitude : she offered me a refuge from myself . “ Your question is not very civilly put , ” I said . “ However , I	1870
the ordinary observer at first sight , but who gains in general estimation on a second , and sometimes on a third view . As for her dress , it studiously conceals , instead of proclaiming , that she has been married that morning . She wears a gray cashmere tunic trimmed with gray silk , and having a skirt of the same material and color beneath it . On her head is a bonnet to match , relieved by a quilling of white muslin with one deep red rose , as a morsel of positive color , to complete the effect of the whole dress . Have I succeeded or failed	1870
this , by discovering a motive which I should be obliged to admit , his end would be gained . Those inquiries which I had pledged myself to pursue -- those inquiries which might , at any moment , take a turn that directly concerned him -- would , in that case , be successfully diverted from the right to the wrong person . The innocent maid would set my strictest scrutiny at defiance ; and Dexter would be safely shielded behind her . I determined to give him time . Not a word passed my lips . The minutes followed each other . I waited in the	1870
with a lock to it , having the words ‘ My Diary ’ inscribed on it in gilt letters . As a matter of course , we took possession of the letters and the Diary , and sealed them up , to be given to the Fiscal . At the same time the gentleman wrote out a protest on the prisoner ’ s behalf , and handed us his card . The card informed us that he was Mr. Playmore , now one of the Agents for the prisoner . The card and the protest were deposited , with the other documents , in the care of the Fiscal . No other discoveries of any importance were made at Gleninch . “ Our next inquiries	1870
. “ You had better go home , madam , ” he said . “ Is the gardener acquainted with your address ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Very well . I will let you know how it ends by means of the gardener . Take my advice . Go home. ” Benjamin placed my arm in his . I looked back , and saw the doctor and the gardener ascending the stairs together on their way to the locked-up room . “ Never mind the doctor , ” I whispered . “ Let ’ s wait in the garden. ” Benjamin would not hear	1870
clear and reasonable as evidence can be. ” “ Of course it is ! ” answered Mrs. Macallan . “ The shorthand writers and reporters put his evidence into presentable language before they printed it . If you had heard what he really said , as I did , you would have been either very much disgusted with him or very much amused by him , according to your way of looking at things . He began , fairly enough , with a modest explanation of his absurd Christian name , which at once checked the merriment of the audience . But as he went on the mad side of him showed itself . He mixed	1870
was speaking . He too had been aroused by the bell . He heard what Mrs. Macallan said to me about the composing draught , and made no remark upon it . It seemed to me that he was alarmed at his wife ’ s faintness . I suggested that she should take a little wine , or brandy and water . She answered that she could swallow nothing so strong as wine or brandy , having a burning pain in her stomach already . I put my hand on her stomach -- quite lightly . She screamed when I touched her . “ This symptom alarmed us . We went	1870
of the principles that have governed my whole life . I can ’ t submit to flat contradiction . Good-morning , Mrs. Eustace -- good-morning. ” He laid my check on the table with a low bow , and left me . Among the curious developments of human stupidity which occasionally present themselves to view , surely the least excusable is the stupidity which , to this day , persists in wondering why the Scotch succeed so well in life ! CHAPTER XLII . MORE SURPRISES . The same evening I received my “ abstract ” by the hands of a clerk . It was an intensely characteristic document . My expenses were remorselessly calculated downward to shillings and even to pence ; and our unfortunate messenger ’ s instructions in respect to his expenditure were reduced to a nicety which must	1870
do a minute since -- tell me all about it . How came you to speak to her , to begin with ? ” “ Your mother told you , Eustace . I was walking just behind her , when she dropped a letter by accident -- ” “ No accident , ” he interposed . “ The letter was dropped on purpose. ” “ Impossible ! ” I exclaimed . “ Why should your mother drop the letter on purpose ? ” “ Use the key to her character , my dear . Eccentricity ! My mother ’ s odd way of making acquaintance with you. ” “ Making acquaintance with me ? I have just told you that I was walking behind her . She could not have known of the existence of such a person as myself until	1870
of myself which I see in the glass ? It is not for me to say . I have done my best to keep clear of the two vanities -- the vanity of depreciating and the vanity of praising my own personal appearance . For the rest , well written or badly written , thank Heaven it is done ! And whom do I see in the glass standing by my side ? I see a man who is not quite so tall as I am , and who has the misfortune of looking older than his years . His forehead is prematurely bald . His big chestnut-colored beard and his long overhanging mustache are prematurely streaked with gray . He has the color in the face which my face wants , and the firmness in his figure which my figure wants . He looks at me with the	1870
, still looking at me . I felt irritated by that fixed look . I arose , and stood before him with my eyes on the floor . He arose in his turn . He understood that the conference was over . “ Well , well , ” he said , with a kind of sad good-humor , “ I suppose it is unreasonable of me to expect that a young woman like you should share any opinion with an old lawyer like me . Let me only remind you that our conversation must remain strictly confidential for the present ; and then let us	1870
to make the position of my unhappy husband more critical than ever . Andrew Kinlay , druggist , of Edinburgh , deposed as follows : “ I keep a special registry book of the poisons sold by me . I produce the book . On the date therein mentioned the prisoner at the bar , Mr. Eustace Macallan , came into my shop , and said that he wished to purchase some arsenic . I asked him what it was wanted for . He told me it was wanted by his gardener , to be used , in solution , for the killing of insects in the greenhouse . At the same time he mentioned his name -- Mr. Macallan , of Gleninch . I at once directed my assistant to put up the arsenic ( two ounces of it ) , and I made the necessary	1870
. You will find it gone . Post yourself quietly in the little study ; and you will discover the Diary ( when Miserrimus Dexter leaves me ) in the hands of your friend. ” * * * * * * * Note by Mr. Playmore : The greatest difficulties of reconstruction occurred in this first portion of the torn letter . In the fourth paragraph from the beginning we have been obliged to supply lost words in no less than three places . In the ninth , tenth , and seventeenth paragraphs the same proceeding was , in a greater or less degree , found to be necessary . In all these cases the utmost pains have been taken to supply the deficiency in exact accordance with what appeared to be the meaning of the writer , as indicated in the existing pieces of the manuscript . * *	1870
sleep . CHAPTER XXVI . MORE OF MY OBSTINACY . ARIEL was downstairs in the shadowy hall , half asleep , half awake , waiting to see the visitors clear of the house . Without speaking to us , without looking at us , she led the way down the dark garden walk , and locked the gate behind us . “ Good-night , Ariel , ” I called out to her over the paling . Nothing answered me but the tramp of her heavy footsteps returning to the house , and the dull thump , a moment afterward , of the closing door . The footman had thoughtfully lighted the carriage lamps . Carrying one of them to	1870
object of loathing to you ; that you shrink from touching me ; that you curse the hour when you were foolish enough to make me your wife . I have struggled as long as I could against the temptation to let him produce his proofs . It was a terrible temptation to a woman who was far from feeling sure of the sincerity of your affection for her ; and it has ended in getting the better of my resistance . I wickedly concealed the disgust which the wretch inspired in me ; I wickedly gave him leave to explain himself ; I wickedly permitted this enemy of yours and of mine to take me into his confidence . And why ? Because I loved you , and you	1870
the hall table . Remember what I have told you about keeping quiet ; good-night ! ’ Eustace retires . Dexter looks at the paper , and reads these lines in pencil : ‘ Just returned . Please forgive me for going to bed without saying good-night . I have overexerted myself ; I am dreadfully fatigued . ( Signed ) Helena. ’ Dexter is by nature suspicious . Dexter suspects Mrs. Beauly . Never mind his reasons ; there is no time to enter into his reasons now . He puts the ease to himself thus : ‘ A weary woman would never have given herself the trouble to write this . She would	1870
You all but frightened him into a fainting fit . What was he afraid of ? ” I tried hard to find an answer to that . I even embarked on an answer without quite knowing where my own words might lead me . Mr. Dexter is an old and true friend of my husband , I began . “ When he heard me say I was not satisfied with the Verdict , he might have felt alarmed -- ” “ He might have felt alarmed at the possible consequences to your husband of reopening the inquiry , ” said Mr. Playmore , ironically finishing the sentence for me . “ Rather far-fetched , Mrs. Eustace ; and not very consistent with your faith in your husband ’ s innocence . Clear your mind of one mistake , ” he continued , seriously	1870
minute I was out in Benjamin ’ s pretty little garden . Composed and strengthened by the inviting solitude and the delicious air , I found courage enough to face the serious question that now confronted me -- the question of the future . I had read the Trial . I had vowed to devote my life to the sacred object of vindicating my husband ’ s innocence . A solitary , defenseless woman , I stood pledged to myself to carry that desperate resolution through to an end . How was I to begin ? The bold way of beginning was surely the wise way in such a position as mine . I had good reasons ( founded , as I have already mentioned , on the important part	1870
-- a fatal mistake . “ It would have been sad enough if Mr. Macallan had only married her without a particle of love on his side . But to make the prospect more hopeless still , he was at that very time the victim of a misplaced attachment to a lady who was engaged to another man . I am well aware that he compassionately denied this , just as he compassionately affected to be in love with my niece when he married her . But his hopeless admiration of the lady whom I have mentioned was a matter	1870
to their patient , I should not have been surprised by this proceeding . But they were at the end of their remedies ; their only business the seemed to be to keep watch . I was puzzled to account for this . Keeping watch was the nurse ’ s business . I thought the conduct of the doctors very strange . “ By the time that the lamp was lighted in the sick-room I could see that the end was near . Excepting an occasional feeling of cramp in her legs , she seemed to suffer less . But her eyes looked sunk in her head ; her skin was cold and clammy ; her lips had turned to a bluish paleness . Nothing roused her now -- excepting the last attempt made by	1870
” “ All , and more , ” I answered . “ What ? what ? what ? ” he cried wild with impatience in a moment . Mr. Playmore ’ s last prophetic words were vividly present to my mind . He had declared , in the most positive manner , that Dexter would persist in misleading me , and would show no signs of astonishment when I repeated what Lady Clarinda had told me of Mrs. Beauly . I resolved to put the lawyer ’ s prophecy -- so far as the question of astonishment was concerned -- to the sharpest attainable test .	1870
now : they were set in a piteous and vacant stare . His once firm hands looked withered ; they trembled as they lay on the coverlet . The paleness of his face ( exaggerated , perhaps , by the black velvet jacket that he wore ) had a sodden and sickly look -- the fine outline was gone . The multitudinous little wrinkles at the corners of his eyes had deepened . His head sank into his shoulders when he leaned forward in his chair . Years appeared to have passed over him , instead of months , while I had been absent from England . Remembering the medical report which Mr. Playmore had given me to read -- recalling the doctor ’ s positively declared opinion that the preservation of Dexter ’ s sanity depended on	1870
of the hard ways of life -- a moment of delicious absorption in each other . I came back to realities fortified and composed , rewarded for all that I had gone through , ready to go through it all over again for another kiss . Only give a woman love , and there is nothing she will not venture , suffer , and do . “ No , they have done with objecting . They have remembered at last that I am of age , and that I can choose for myself . They have been pleading with me , Eustace , to give you up . My aunt , whom I thought rather a	1870
sly as a fox . Mind he doesn ’ t discover you. ’ Mrs. Beauly answered , ‘ You go first , and look out in front ; I will follow you , and make sure there is nobody behind us. ’ With that they disappeared around the corner of the house . In five minutes more I heard the door of Mrs. Beauly ’ s room softly opened and closed again . Three hours later the nurse met her in the corridor , innocently on her way to make inquiries at Mrs. Eustace Macallan ’ s door . What do you think of these circumstances ? What do you think of Mrs. Beauly and her maid having something to say to each other , which they didn ’ t dare say in the house -- for fear of my being behind some door listening to them ? What	1870
narrative , which set every nerve in me on edge as I looked at him . “ I see nothing to laugh at , ” I said , sharply . His beautiful blue eyes rested on me with a look of innocent surprise . “ Nothing to laugh at , ” he repeated , “ in such an exhibition of human folly as you have just described ? ” His expression suddenly changed his face darkened and hardened very strangely . “ Stop ! ” he cried , before I could answer him . “ There can be only one reason for you ’ re	1870
I paused at the same moment , feeling that I could venture no further without the risk of offending him . To speak the truth , his conduct , when he first mentioned our engagement to my uncle , had been ( so far as appearances went ) a little flighty and strange . The vicar had naturally questioned him about his family . He had answered that his father was dead ; and he had consented , though not very readily , to announce his contemplated marriage to his mother . Informing us that she too lived in the country , he had gone to see her , without more particularly mentioning her address . In two days he had returned to the Vicarage	1870
answer to questions asked by the procurator-fiscal or by myself. ” A clerk in the Sheriff-Clerk ’ s office then officially produced the Declaration , and corroborated the evidence of the witness who had preceded him . The appearance of the next witness created a marked sensation in the Court . This was no less a person than the nurse who had attended Mrs. Macallan in her last illness -- by name Christina Ormsay . After the first formal answers , the nurse ( examined by the Lord Advocate ) proceeded to say : “ I was first sent for to attend the deceased lady on the 7th of October . She was then suffering from a severe cold ,	1870
door ? ” “ Step softly , ” my mother-in-law answered , “ and come and see. ” She arranged the tapestry behind us so as completely to shut out the light in the circular room . Then noiselessly turning the handle , she opened the heavy door . We kept ourselves concealed in the shadow of the recess , and looked through the open doorway . I saw ( or fancied I saw , in the obscurity ) a long room with a low ceiling . The dying gleam of an ill-kept fire formed the only light by which I could judge of objects and distances . Redly illuminating the central portion of the room , opposite to which	1870
crossed my mind that Mrs. Macallan could introduce me , if she pleased , to Miserrimus Dexter . She must know him , and know him well , as a guest at Gleninch and an old friend of her son . “ I mean to consult Miserrimus Dexter , ” I answered , boldly . Mrs. Macallan started back from me with a loud exclamation of surprise . “ Are you out of your senses ? ” she asked . I told her , as I had told Major Fitz-David , that I had reason to think Mr. Dexter ’ s advice might be of real assistance to me at starting . “ And I , ” rejoined Mrs. Macallan , “ have reason to think that your whole project is a mad one , and that in asking Dexter ’ s advice on it you appropriately consult a	1870
fragments of a tradesman ’ s prospectus . Nothing dismayed , Benjamin and the young chemist still persevered . At the end of the day ’ s work more pieces of paper were turned up . These proved to be covered with written characters . Mr. Playmore ( arriving at Gleninch , as usual , every evening on the conclusion of his labors in the law ) was consulted as to the handwriting . After careful examination , he declared that the mutilated portions of sentences submitted to him had been written , beyond all doubt , by Eustace Macallan ’ s first wife ! This discovery aroused the enthusiasm of the searchers to fever height . Spades and sieves were from that moment forbidden utensils	1870
brought herself to do . And yet , on the other hand , how in Heaven ’ s name could I give up my grand enterprise at the very time when even wise and prudent Mr. Playmore saw such a prospect of succeeding in it that he had actually volunteered to help me ? Placed between those two cruel alternatives , which could I choose ? Think of your own frailties , and have some mercy on mine . I turned my back on both the alternatives . Those two agreeable fiends , Prevarication and Deceit , took me , as it were , softly by the hand : “ Don ’ t commit yourself either way , my dear , ” they said , in their	1870
Eustace refused to follow her advice , and to tell you what his position really was . On my part I did all I could to support Mrs. Macallan in the course that she took . When Eustace wrote to tell me that he had engaged himself to marry a niece of my good friend Doctor Starkweather , and that he had mentioned me as his reference , I wrote back to warn him that I would have nothing to do with the affair unless he revealed the whole truth about himself to his future wife . He refused to listen to me , as he had refused to listen to his mother ; and he held me at the same time to my promise to keep his	1870
the Court had passed over without notice . The last witness had been now examined . The chair on wheels glided away with the half-man in it , and was lost in a distant corner of the Court . The Lord Advocate rose to address the Jury for the prosecution . I do not scruple to say that I never read anything so infamous as this great lawyer ’ s speech . He was not ashamed to declare , at starting , that he firmly believed the prisoner to be guilty . What right had he to say anything of the sort ? Was it for _him_ to decide ? Was he the Judge and	1870
that you will shrink , in pity to _him , _ from letting him see it . How he is to be kept in ignorance of what we have discovered is another question , the discussion of which must be deferred until we can consult together . Until that time comes , I can only repeat my advice -- wait till the next news reaches you from Gleninch. ” I waited . What I suffered , what Eustace thought of me , does not matter . Nothing matters now but the facts . In less than a fortnight more the task of restoring the letter was completed . Excepting certain instances , in which the morsels of the torn paper had been irretrievably lost --	1870
misguided , so pitiably wrong ! The one chance for both of us , and the one consolation for poor Me , was to hold to my desperate resolution more firmly than ever . If I had wanted anything to confirm me in this view , and to arm me against the remonstrances of every one of my friends , Eustace ’ s letter would have proved more than sufficient to answer the purpose . At least he had not forgotten me ; he thought of me , and he mourned the loss of me every day of his life . That was encouragement enough -- for the	1870
placed her reputation at the mercy of the world . It rested with me to silence the scandalous tongues that reviled her . With Helena lost to me , happiness was not to be expected . All women were equally indifferent to me . A generous action would be the salvation of this woman . Why not perform it ? I married her on that impulse -- married her just as I might have jumped into the water and saved her if she had been drowning ; just as I might have knocked a man down if I had seen him ill-treating her in the street ! “ And now the woman for whom I have made this sacrifice stands between me and my Helena -- my Helena , free to pour out all the treasures of	1870
, as if I had committed a fraud on the public ! ” As for the favored object of this quaint mixture of admiration and regret , she was pleased to receive me graciously , as an old friend . While Eustace was talking to the Major , the bride drew me aside out of their hearing , and explained her motives for marrying , with a candor which was positively shameless . “ You see we are a large family at home , quite unprovided for ! ” this odious young woman whispered in my ear . “ It ’ s all very well about my being a ‘ Queen of Song ’ and the rest of it . Lord bless you , I have been often enough to the opera , and I have learned enough of my music-master , to know what	1870
for the passage of any larger vehicle , and stopped at a wall and a gate that were new objects to me . Opening the gate with her key , and leading the pony , Ariel introduced me to the back garden and yard of Miserrimus Dexter ’ s rotten and rambling old house . The pony walked off independently to his stable , with the chaise behind him . My silent companion led me through a bleak and barren kitchen , and along a stone passage . Opening a door at the end , she admitted me to the back of the hall , into which Mrs. Macallan and I had penetrated by the front entrance to the house . Here Ariel lifted a whistle which hung around her neck , and blew the shrill trilling notes with the	1870

Post yourself quietly in the little study ; and you will discover the Diary ( when Miserrimus Dexter leaves me ) in the hands of your friend. ” * * * * * * * Note by Mr. Playmore : The greatest difficulties of reconstruction occurred in this first portion of the torn letter .

then too lazy to go on walking . My bed looked wonderfully inviting as I passed by the open window of my room . In five minutes more I had accepted the invitation of the bed , and had said farewell to my anxieties and my troubles . In five minutes more I was fast asleep . A discreetly gentle knock at my door was the first sound that aroused me . I heard the voice of my good old Benjamin speaking outside . “ My dear ! I am afraid you will be starved if I let you sleep any longer . It is half-past one o ’ clock ; and a friend of yours has come to lunch with us. ” A friend of mine ? What	1870
meet her under an assumed name. ” “ I can go to the dinner , ” I said , “ under the name in which Eustace married me . I can go as ‘ Mrs . Woodville. ’ ” “ The very thing ! ” he exclaimed . “ What would I not give to be present when Lady Clarinda introduces you to Mrs. Beauly ! Think of the situation . A woman with a hideous secret hidden in her inmost soul : and another woman who knows of it -- another woman who is bent , by fair means or foul , on dragging that secret into the light of day . What a struggle ! What a plot for a novel ! I am in a fever when I think of it . I am beside myself when I look into the future , and see Mrs. Borgia-Beauly	1870
I can refuse nothing to a pretty woman . Dear and admirable lady , don ’ t abuse your influence ! don ’ t make an old soldier false to his word of honor ! ” I tried to say something here in defense of my motives . The Major clasped his hands entreatingly , and looked at me with a pleading simplicity wonderful to see . “ Why press it ? ” he asked . “ I offer no resistance . I am a lamb -- why sacrifice me ? I acknowledge your power ; I throw myself on your mercy . All the misfortunes of my youth and my manhood have come to me through women . I am not a bit better in my age -- I am	1870
to New York , or not . I can find the right man for the purpose ; and I estimate the expense ( including a telegram ) -- ” “ Never mind the expense ! ” I interposed , losing all patience with the eminently Scotch view of the case which put my purse in the first place of importance . “ I don ’ t care for the expense ; I want to know what you have discovered. ” He smiled . “ She doesn ’ t care for the expense , ” he said to himself , pleasantly . “ How like a woman ! ” I might have retorted , “ He thinks of the expense before he thinks of anything else . How like a Scotchman	1870
s expected from me this time ? ” The cab was announced to be waiting for us at the gate as he asked the question . I rose and took his arm , and gave him a grateful kiss on his rosy old cheek . “ Only two things , ” I said . “ Sit down behind Mr. Dexter ’ s chair , so that he can ’ t see you . But take care to place yourself , at the same time , so that you can see me. ” “ The less I see of Mr. Dexter the better I shall be pleased , ” growled Benjamin	1870
Major . I will ask nothing of you but what you have just offered to me of your own accord. ” “ What have I offered ? ” he inquired , looking a little alarmed . “ Nothing that you need repent of , ” I answered ; “ nothing which is not easy for you to grant . May I ask a bold question ? Suppose this house was mine instead of yours ? ” “ Consider it yours , ” cried the gallant old gentleman . “ From the garret to the kitchen , consider it yours ! ” “ A thousand thanks , Major ; I will consider it mine for the moment . You know -- everybody knows -- that one of a woman ’ s many weaknesses is curiosity . Suppose my curiosity led me to examine everything in my new	1870

You will be good enough maturely to consider the same , making any remarks on it , tending to economy , which may suggest themselves to your mind at the time . And you will further oblige me , if you approve of the abstract , by yourself filling in the blank space on your check with the needful amount in words and figures . No , madam ! I really can	1870
prevented me from ever returning to my husband ? Was that what he meant ? Did the sort of discovery that he contemplated mean something so dreadful that it would have parted us at once and forever ? I stood by his chair in silence , and tried to find the answer to those terrible questions in his face . It used to speak to me so eloquently when it spoke of his love . It told me nothing now . He sat for some time without looking at me , lost in his own thoughts . Then he rose on a sudden and took his hat . “ The friend who lent me the yacht	1870

May I make mine ? ” Major Fitz-David lifted my hand again from my lap and drew his chair as close as possible to mine . I looked at him gravely and tried to release	1870

sinks in me again -- as it sank on that never-to-be-forgotten evening -- while I sit at my desk thinking of it . “ So Dexter really spoke to you of Mrs. Beauly ! ” exclaimed Lady Clarinda . “ You have no idea how you surprise me. ” “ May I ask why ? ” “ He hates her ! The last time I saw him he wouldn ’ t allow me to mention her name . It is one of his innumerable oddities . If any such feeling as sympathy is a possible feeling in such a nature as his , he ought to like Helena Beauly . She is the most completely unconventional person I know . When she	1870
s officers were in search of my husband ’ s papers . Referring back to the evidence Of “ Isaiah Schoolcraft , ” I found that Mr. Playmore had been called in to assist and advise Eustace by Miserrimus Dexter . He was therefore not only a friend on whom I might rely , but a friend who was personally acquainted with Dexter as well . Could there be a fitter man to apply to for enlightenment in the darkness that had now gathered around me ? Benjamin , when I put the question to him , acknowledged that I had made a sensible choice on this occasion , and at once exerted himself to help me . He discovered ( through his own lawyer ) the address of Mr. Playmore ’ s London agents ; and from these gentlemen he	1870
moment of delicious absorption in each other . I came back to realities fortified and composed , rewarded for all that I had gone through , ready to go through it all over again for another kiss . Only give a woman love , and there is nothing she will not venture , suffer , and do . “ No , they have done with objecting . They have remembered at last that I am of age , and that I can choose for myself . They have been pleading with me , Eustace , to give you up . My aunt , whom I thought rather a hard woman , has been crying -- for the first time in my experience	1870
“ Your discovery ( as you call it ) may be enough for _you_ ; it is not enough for _me_ . How do we know that Mrs. Macallan may not have been twice married ? and that her first husband ’ s name may not have been Woodville ? ” The landlady ’ s astonishment subsided in its turn , and the landlady ’ s curiosity succeeded as the ruling influence of the moment . Substantially , as I have already said of her , she was a good-natured woman . Her fits of temper ( as is usual with good-natured people )	1870
began my first examination of the four walls around me , and of all that they inclosed . I was amazed at my own calmness . My interview with Major Fitz-David had , perhaps , exhausted my capacity for feeling any strong emotion , for the time at least . It was a relief to me to be alone ; it was a relief to me to begin the search . Those were my only sensations so far . The shape of the room was oblong . Of the two shorter walls , one contained the door in grooves which I have already mentioned as communicating with the front room ; the other was almost entirely occupied by the broad window which looked out on the courtyard . Taking the doorway wall	1870
obstacle -- an ‘ utterly distasteful ’ obstacle -- between you and the woman whom you love so dearly that you ‘ adore the earth which she touches with her foot. ’ Be it so ! I will stand in your way no longer . It is no sacrifice and no merit on my part . Life is unendurable to me , now I know that the man whom I love with all my heart and soul secretly shrinks from me whenever I touch him . “ I have got the means of death close at hand . “ The arsenic that I twice asked you to buy for me is in	1870
thought to myself ) am I to examine all these books ? And what am I to look for , even if I do examine them all ? Major Fitz-David had spoken of a terrible misfortune which had darkened my husband ’ s past life . In what possible way could any trace of that misfortune , or any suggestive hint of something resembling it , exist in the archives of the “ Annual Register ” or in the pages of Voltaire ? The bare idea of such a thing seemed absurd The mere attempt to make a serious examination in this direction was surely a wanton waste of time . And yet the Major had certainly stolen a look at the book-case . And again , the broken vase	1870
, the man who knew where the clew was to be found , had been watching me at the book-case ! There was no doubt of it now . Major Fitz-David had shown me the hiding-place of the secret in spite of himself ! I looked with indifference at the other pieces of furniture , ranged against the fourth wall , which I had not examined yet . I surveyed , without the slightest feeling of curiosity , all the little elegant trifles scattered on the tables and on the chimney-piece , each one of which might have been an object of suspicion to me under other circumstances .	1870
The top was ornamented by vases , candelabra , and statuettes , in pairs , placed in a row . Looking along the row , I noticed a vacant space on the top of the bookcase at the extremity of it which was nearest to the window . The opposite extremity , nearest to the door , was occupied by a handsome painted vase of a very peculiar pattern . Where was the corresponding vase , which ought to have been placed at the corresponding extremity of the book-case ? I returned to the open sixth drawer of the cabinet , and looked in again . There was no mistaking the pattern on the fragments	1870
the Dean of Faculty sat down ; and the medical witnesses were called next . Here the evidence was simply irresistible . Dr. Jerome and Mr. Gale positively swore that the symptoms of the illness were the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic . The surgeon who had performed the post-mortem examination followed . He positively swore that the appearance of the internal organs proved Doctor Jerome and Mr. Gale to be right in declaring that their patient had died poisoned . Lastly , to complete this overwhelming testimony , two analytical chemists actually produced in Court the arsenic which they had found in the body , in a quantity admittedly sufficient to have killed two	1870
This I know for certain , we forgot our breeding as lady and gentleman : we looked at each other in barbarous silence . I was the first to recover myself . What did I say to him ? I said something about my not being hurt , and then something more , urging him to run back and try if he might not yet recover the fish . He went back unwillingly . He returned to me -- of course without the fish . Knowing how bitterly disappointed my uncle would have been in his place , I apologized very earnestly . In my eagerness to make atonement , I even offered to show him a spot where he might try again , lower down the stream . He would not hear of it ; he entreated me to go home and change my wet dress . I cared	1870
the secret pleasure of filling my mind with him , while I felt him by my side , was a luxury in itself . I pictured in my thoughts our first meeting in the neighborhood of my uncle ’ s house . Our famous north-country trout stream wound its flashing and foaming way through a ravine in the rocky moorland . It was a windy , shadowy evening . A heavily clouded sunset lay low and red in the west . A solitary angler stood casting his fly at a turn in the stream where the backwater lay still and deep under an overhanging bank . A girl ( myself ) standing on the bank , invisible to the fisherman beneath , waited eagerly to see the trout rise . The	1870
Good Heavens ! The effort of my life is _not_ to notice her in anything she does or says . How could I keep my temper , unless I kept as much as possible out of the way of private interviews with her ? And I do keep my temper . I am never hard on her ; I never use harsh language to her . She has a double claim on my forbearance -- -she is a woman , and the law has made her my wife . I remember this ; but I am human . The less I see of her -- except when visitors are present -- the more certain I can feel of preserving my self-control . “ I wonder what it is that makes her so	1870
going on in the room above . The future prima donna had done practicing her scales , and was trying her voice now in selections from Italian operas . At the moment when I first heard her she was singing the beautiful air from the _Somnambula , _ “ Come per me sereno. ” I never hear that delicious melody , to this day , without being instantly transported in imagination to the fatal back-room in Vivian Place . The Major -- strongly affected himself by this time -- was the first to break the silence . “ Sit down again , ” he said ; “ and pray take the easy-chair . You are very much agitated ; you want rest. ” He was right . I could stand no longer ; I dropped into the chair . Major Fitz-David rang the bell , and spoke a few	1870
talked of by-gone days . For a little while I was almost happy in the company of my fatherly old friend . Why was I not old too ? Why had I not done with love , with its certain miseries , its transient delights , its cruel losses , its bitterly doubtful gains ? The last autumn flowers in the window basked brightly in the last of the autumn sunlight . Benjamin ’ s little dog digested his dinner in perfect comfort on the hearth . The parrot in the next house screeched his vocal accomplishments cheerfully . I don ’ t doubt that it is a great privilege to be a human being . But may it	1870
position I saw her face plainly , and I knew it for the face of the young widow lady who was visiting at the house . She was pointed out to me by the head-gardener when she first arrived , for the purpose of warning me that I was not to interfere if I found her picking the flowers . The gardens at Gleninch were shown to tourists on certain days , and we made a difference , of course , in the matter of the flowers between strangers and guests staying in the house . I am quite certain of the	1870
it in time -- or if the sheriff ’ s officers had not been too quick for him -- there can be no reasonable doubt that Dexter would have himself destroyed the Diary , foreseeing the consequences of its production in court . So strongly does he appear to have felt these considerations , that he even resisted the officers in the execution of their duty . His agitation when he sent for Mr. Playmore to interfere was witnessed by that gentleman , and ( it may not be amiss to add ) was genuine agitation beyond dispute . “	1870
step , with a bitter smile . “ We have only been married a few days , Valeria . Your love for me is new and young . Time , which wears away all things , will wear away the first fervor of that love. ” “ Never ! never ! ” He drew back from me a little further still . “ Look at the world around you , ” he said . “ The happiest husbands and wives have their occasional misunderstandings and disagreements ; the brightest married life has its passing clouds . When those days come for _us , _ the doubts and fears that you don	1870
s death , did I understand you to say that he looked at you suspiciously ? ” “ Very suspiciously. ” “ And his face cleared up again when you told him that your question was only suggested by what you had read in the Report of the Trial ? ” “ Yes. ” He drew a slip of paper out of the drawer in his desk , dipped his pen in the ink , considered a little , and placed a chair for me close at his side . “ The lawyer disappears , ” he said , “ and the man resumes his proper place . There shall be no professional mysteries between you and me . As your husband ’ s old friend , Mrs.	1870
. He presented me with his credentials in the shape of a little note from the lawyer . “ There are some few points ” ( Mr. Playmore wrote ) “ which the recovery of the letter does not seem to clear up . I have done my best , with Mr. Benjamin ’ s assistance , to find the right explanation of these debatable matters ; and I have treated the subject , for the sake of brevity , in the form of Questions and Answers . Will you accept me as interpreter , after the mistakes I made when you consulted me in Edinburgh ? Events , I admit , have proved that I was entirely wrong in trying to prevent you from returning	1870
. I looked about me in the room . The same insatiable relish for horrors exhibited downstairs by the pictures in the hall was displayed again here . The photographs hanging on the wall represented the various forms of madness taken from the life . The plaster casts ranged on the shelf opposite were casts ( after death ) of the heads of famous murderers . A frightful little skeleton of a woman hung in a cupboard , behind a glazed door , with this cynical inscription placed above the skull : “ Behold the scaffolding on which beauty is built ! ” In a corresponding cupboard , with the door wide open , there hung in loose folds a shirt ( as I took it to be ) of chamois leather	1870
is the best and dearest of men , ” I answered . “ But there is some dreadful mystery in his past life -- ” I could get no further ; Major Fitz-David deliberately stopped me . He did it with the smoothest politeness , on the surface . But I saw a look in his bright little eyes which said , plainly , “ If you _will_ venture on delicate ground , madam , don ’ t ask me to accompany you. ” “ My charming friend ! ” he exclaimed . “ May I call you my charming friend ? You have -- among a thousand other delightful qualities which I can see already -- a vivid imagination . Don ’ t let it get the upper hand . Take an old fellow ’ s advice ; don ’ t let it get the upper hand	1870
be free , what a happy man I might have been ! ’ The lady ’ s voice answered , ‘ Hush ! you must not talk so. ’ My master said upon that , ‘ I must talk of what is in my mind ; it is always in my mind that I have lost you. ’ He stopped a bit there , and then he said on a sudden , ‘ Do me one favor , my angel ! Promise me not to marry again. ’ The lady ’ s voice spoke out thereupon sharply enough , ‘ What do you mean ? ’ My master said , ‘ I wish no harm to	1870
with him , and while away the weary time by reading to him and talking to him . My niece was foremost among these volunteer nurses . She played admirably on the piano ; and the sick man happened -- most unfortunately , as the event proved -- to be fond of music . “ The consequences of the perfectly innocent intercourse thus begun were deplorable consequences for my niece . She became passionately attached to Mr. Eustace Macallan , without awakening any corresponding affection on his side . “ I did my best to interfere , delicately and usefully , while it was still possible to interfere with advantage .	1870
eyes on the ground , with a strange appearance of confusion and distress in his face , he too moved away out of my sight . The unknown man whom I had first noticed followed him out of the room . I called after him faintly , “ Eustace ! ” He never answered ; he never returned . With an effort I moved my head on the pillow , so as to look round on the other side of the sofa . Another familiar face appeared before me as if in a dream . My good old Benjamin was sitting watching me , with the tears in his eyes . He rose and took my hand silently , in his	1870
“ Consider it yours , ” cried the gallant old gentleman . “ From the garret to the kitchen , consider it yours ! ” “ A thousand thanks , Major ; I will consider it mine for the moment . You know -- everybody knows -- that one of a woman ’ s many weaknesses is curiosity . Suppose my curiosity led me to examine everything in my new house ? ” “ Yes ? ” “ Suppose I went from room to room , and searched everything , and peeped in everywhere ? Do you think there would be any chance -- ” The quick-witted Major anticipated	1870
but still they took it in turns to eat their meal , one relieving the other at the bedside . If they had administered remedies to their patient , I should not have been surprised by this proceeding . But they were at the end of their remedies ; their only business the seemed to be to keep watch . I was puzzled to account for this . Keeping watch was the nurse ’ s business . I thought the conduct of the doctors very strange . “ By the time that the lamp was lighted in the sick-room I could see that the end was near . Excepting an occasional feeling of cramp in her legs , she seemed to suffer less . But her eyes looked sunk in her head ; her skin was cold and clammy ; her lips had turned to a bluish paleness .	1870
might have acted in my place . It is true of me , that my husband ’ s terrible warning -- all the more terrible in its mystery and its vagueness -- produced no deterrent effect on my mind : it only stimulated my resolution to discover what he was hiding from me . He had not been gone two minutes before I rang the bell and ordered the carriage , to take me to Major Fitz-David ’ s house in Vivian Place . Walking to and fro while I was waiting -- I was in such a fever of excitement that it was impossible for me to sit still -- I accidentally caught sight of myself in the glass . My own face startled me , it looked so haggard and so wild . Could I present myself	1870
. “ My darling , you don ’ t know how you amuse me. ” It was all forced : it was all unnatural . He , the most delicate , the most refined of men -- a gentleman in the highest sense of the word -- was coarse and loud and vulgar ! My heart sank under a sudden sense of misgiving which , with all my love for him , it was impossible to resist . In unutterable distress and alarm I asked myself , “ Is my husband beginning to deceive me ? is he acting a part , and acting it badly , before we have been married a week ? ” I	1870
next . The confinement to the four walls of the room began to be intolerable to me . I opened the door that led into my husband ’ s dressing-room , and entered it , to try if the change would relieve me . The first object that I noticed was his dressing-case , open on the toilet-table . I took out the bottles and pots and brushes and combs , the knives and scissors in one compartment , the writing materials in another . I smelled the perfumes and pomatums ; I busily cleaned and dusted the bottles with my handkerchief as I took them out . Little by little I completely emptied the dressing-case . It was lined with blue velvet . In one corner I noticed a tiny slip of loose blue silk	1870

I shall think of you just as much as I do now , for you ’ re bound up with what I can no more help remembering than I can help my heart beating. ” Poor Adam ! Thus do men blunder . Dinah made no answer , but she presently said , “ Have you heard any news from that poor young man , since we last spoke of him ? ” Dinah always called Arthur so ; she had never lost the image of him as she had seen him in the prison . “ Yes , ” said Adam . “ Mr . Irwine	1860
by old Mr. Donnithorne himself , for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber . This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud , since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door . And soon they became suddenly silent ; for Mr. Irwine ’ s voice had ceased , and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church . They all moved aside , and stood with their hats off , while Mr. Irwine passed . Adam and Seth were coming next , with their mother between them ; for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk , and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry . But	1860
rhythm in the tick . “ What a time o ’ night this is to come home , Hetty ! ” said Mrs. Poyser . “ Look at the clock , do ; why , it ’ s going on for half-past nine , and I ’ ve sent the gells to bed this half-hour , and late enough too ; when they ’ ve got to get up at half after four , and the mowers ’ bottles to fill , and the baking ; and here ’ s this blessed child wi ’ the fever for what I know , and as wakeful as if it was dinner-time , and nobody to help me to	1860
it ’ s like enough the tramps know where we ’ re going as well as we do oursens ; for if Old Harry wants any work done , you may be sure he ’ ll find the means. ” “ Nonsense about murdering us in our beds , ” said Mr. Poyser ; “ I ’ ve got a gun i ’ our room , hanna I ? and thee ’ st got ears as ’ ud find it out if a mouse was gnawing the bacon . Howiver , if thee wouldstna be easy , Alick can stay at home i ’ the forepart o ’ the day , and Tim can come back tow ’ rds five o ’ clock , and let Alick have his turn .

time in coming to Mr. Massey ’ s day-school as soon as he was old enough . It was touching to see these three big men , with the marks of their hard labour about them , anxiously bending over the worn books and painfully making out , “ The grass is green , ” “ The sticks are dry , ” “ The corn is ripe ” —a very hard lesson to pass to after columns of single words all alike except in the first letter . It was almost as if three rough animals were making humble efforts to	1860
way in a strange dream that seemed to have begun in bewildering delight and was now passing into contrarieties and sadness . Would he meet her again as she came home ? Why had he spoken almost as if he were displeased with her ? And then run away so suddenly ? She cried , hardly knowing why . Arthur too was very uneasy , but his feelings were lit up for him by a more distinct consciousness . He hurried to the Hermitage , which stood in the heart of the wood , unlocked the door with a hasty wrench , slammed it after him , pitched _Zeluco_ into the most distant corner , and thrusting his right hand into his pocket , first walked	1860
sieve under the pump and expect to carry away the water. ” “ That difficulty—about the fetching and carrying—you will not have , Mrs. Poyser , ” said the squire , who thought that this entrance into particulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on Mrs. Poyser ’ s part . “ Bethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony. ” “ Oh , sir , begging your pardon , I ’ ve never been used t ’ having gentlefolks ’ s servants coming about my back places , a-making love to both the gells at once and keeping ’ em with their hands on their hips listening to all manner o ’ gossip when they	1860
I should ever do that , sir , ” said Adam , looking round at Arthur and smiling . “ I used to fight for fun , but I ’ ve never done that since I was the cause o ’ poor Gil Tranter being laid up for a fortnight . I ’ ll never fight any man again , only when he behaves like a scoundrel . If you get hold of a chap that ’ s got no shame nor conscience to stop him , you must try what you can do by bunging his eyes up. ” Arthur did not laugh , for he was preoccupied with some thought that made him say presently , “ I should think now , Adam , you never have any struggles within yourself . I	1860
would be held in restraint by timidity , and during the next three days , the intervals in which she had an opportunity of speaking to Adam were too rare and short to cause her any strong temptation . But in her long solitary hours she brooded over her regretful thoughts about Dinah , till they had grown very near that point of unmanageable strength when thoughts are apt to take wing out of their secret nest in a startling manner . And on Sunday morning , when Seth went away to chapel at Treddleston , the dangerous opportunity came . Sunday morning was the happiest time in all the week to Lisbeth , for as there was no service at Hayslope church till the afternoon , Adam was always at home , doing nothing but reading , an occupation in which she could venture to	1860
done by building with ill-seasoned timber—by ignorant men in fine clothes making plans for outhouses and workshops and the like without knowing the bearings of things—by slovenly joiners ’ work , and by hasty contracts that could never be fulfilled without ruining somebody ; and he resolved , for his part , to set his face against such doings . On these points he would have maintained his opinion against the largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or Stonyshire either ; but he felt that beyond these it would be better for him to defer to people who were more knowing than himself . He saw as plainly as possible how ill the woods on the estate were managed , and the shameful state of	1860
serious love for her . Possibly you think that Adam was not at all sagacious in his interpretations , and that it was altogether extremely unbecoming in a sensible man to behave as he did—falling in love with a girl who really had nothing more than her beauty to recommend her , attributing imaginary virtues to her , and even condescending to cleave to her after she had fallen in love with another man , waiting for her kind looks as a patient trembling dog waits for his master ’ s eye to be turned upon him . But in so complex a thing as human nature , we must consider , it is hard to find rules without exceptions . Of course , I know that , as a rule , sensible men fall in love with the	1860
man ’ s feelings had been in moments of humiliation , when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son . When our indignation is borne in submissive silence , we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own generosity , if not justice ; how much more when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence , and we have seen his face for the last time in the meekness of death ! “ Ah ! I was always too hard , ” Adam said to himself . “ It ’ s a sore fault in me as I ’ m so hot and out o ’ patience with people when they do wrong , and my heart gets shut up against ’ em , so as I can ’ t bring myself to forgive	1860
, “ In the midst of life we are in death ” —how the present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy , of righteous dealing , and of family tenderness . All very old truths—but what we thought the oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives . For when men want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light , do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects	1860
which her feelings might have in the future . That was the one sharp point which pressed against him ; every other he could evade by hopeful self-persuasion . The whole thing had been secret ; the Poysers had not the shadow of a suspicion . No one , except Adam , knew anything of what had passed—no one else was likely to know ; for Arthur had impressed on Hetty that it would be fatal to betray , by word or look , that there had been the least intimacy between them ; and Adam , who knew half their	1860
, for she has a kind heart , ’ and I ’ m sure I ’ ve found it so. ” “ I don ’ t know how , child ; anybody ’ ud be cunning to do anything for you , I think ; you ’ re like the birds o ’ th ’ air , and live nobody knows how . I ’ d ha ’ been glad to behave to you like a mother ’ s sister , if you ’ d come and live i ’ this country where there ’ s some shelter and victual for man and beast , and folks don ’ t live on the naked hills , like poultry a-scratching on a gravel bank . And then you might get married to some decent man , and there ’ d be plenty ready to have you ,	1860
There may be a new leading. ” “ Let us leave that , Seth . It ’ s good to live only a moment at a time , as I ’ ve read in one of Mr. Wesley ’ s books . It isn ’ t for you and me to lay plans ; we ’ ve nothing to do but to obey and to trust . Farewell. ” Dinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes , and then passed through the gate , while Seth turned away to walk lingeringly home . But instead of taking the direct road , he chose to turn back along the fields through which he and Dinah had already passed ; and I think his blue linen handkerchief was very wet with tears long before he had made up his mind	1860
th ’ ’ ear . We shall see you living on th ’ hill before another twelvemont ’ s over. ” “ Well , ” said Adam , “ I should like t ’ have the business in my own hands . It isn ’ t as I mind much about getting any more money . We ’ ve enough and to spare now , with only our two selves and mother ; but I should like t ’ have my own way about things—I could try plans then , as I can ’ t do now. ” “ You get on pretty well wi ’ the new steward , I reckon ? ” said Mr. Poyser . “ Yes , yes ; he ’ s a sensible man enough ; understands farming—he ’ s carrying on	1860
sit in a spring-cart o ’ your own , if you ’ ve got a soft to drive you : he ’ ll soon turn you over into the ditch . I allays said I ’ d never marry a man as had got no brains ; for where ’ s the use of a woman having brains of her own if she ’ s tackled to a geck as everybody ’ s a-laughing at ? She might as well dress herself fine to sit back ’ ards on a donkey. ” These expressions , though figurative , sufficiently indicated the bent of Mrs. Poyser ’ s mind with regard to Adam ; and though she and her husband might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a daughter of their	1860
the apricot , but it is gone for ever from our imagination , and we can only _believe_ in the joy of childhood . But the first glad moment in our first love is a vision which returns to us to the last , and brings with it a thrill of feeling intense and special as the recurrent sensation of a sweet odour breathed in a far-off hour of happiness . It is a memory that gives a more exquisite touch to tenderness , that feeds the madness of jealousy and adds the last keenness to the agony of despair . Hetty bending over the red bunches , the level rays piercing the screen of apple-tree boughs , the length of bushy garden beyond , his own emotion as he looked	1860
, when Adam was out of on the causeway . “ Sitting up till past twelve to do extry work ! Ye ’ ll not find many men o ’ six-an ’ twenty as ’ ull do to put i ’ the shafts wi ’ him . If you can catch Adam for a husband , Hetty , you ’ ll ride i ’ your own spring-cart some day , I ’ ll be your warrant. ” Hetty was moving across the kitchen with the currants , so her uncle did not see the little toss of the head with which she answered him . To ride in a spring-cart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now . Chapter XXI The Night-School and the Schoolmaster Bartle Massey ’ s was one of a few scattered	1860
seeming to trace the pattern of the quarries with his eye . “ Aye , it ’ s ill livin ’ in a hen-roost for them as doesn ’ t like fleas , ” said Mrs. Poyser . “ We ’ ve all had our turn at bein ’ young , I reckon , be ’ t good luck or ill. ” “ But she must learn to ’ commodate herself to young women , ” said Mr. Poyser , “ for it isn ’ t to be counted on as Adam and Seth ’ ull keep bachelors for the next ten year to please their mother . That ’ ud be unreasonable . It isn ’ t right for old nor young nayther to make a bargain all o ’ their own side . What ’ s good for one ’ s good all round i ’ the	1860
in the winter if you ’ re ill. Don ’ t think I will ever stay away from you if you ’ re in real want of me . But , indeed , it is needful for my own soul that I should go away from this life of ease and luxury in which I have all things too richly to enjoy—at least that I should go away for a short space . No one can know but myself what are my inward needs , and the besetments I am most in danger from . Your wish for me to stay is not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own desires ; it is a temptation that I must resist , lest the love of the creature should become like	1860
pool , low down , like that in the Scantlands ; wondering if it were very painful to be drowned , and if there would be anything worse after death than what she dreaded in life . Religious doctrines had taken no hold on Hetty ’ s mind . She was one of those numerous people who have had godfathers and godmothers , learned their catechism , been confirmed , and gone to church every Sunday , and yet , for any practical result of strength in life , or trust in death , have never appropriated a single Christian idea or Christian feeling . You would misunderstand her thoughts during these wretched days , if you imagined	1860
preach a great deal more about that spiritual part of religion that you talk of , Adam ? Couldn ’ t you get more out of his sermons than out of Mr. Irwine ’ s ? ” “ Eh , I knowna . He preached a deal about doctrines . But I ’ ve seen pretty clear , ever since I was a young un , as religion ’ s something else besides doctrines and notions . I look at it as if the doctrines was like finding names for your feelings , so as you can talk of ’ em when you ’ ve never known ’ em , just as a man may talk o ’ tools when he knows their names , though he	1860
of August was one of these days when the sunshine looked brighter in all eyes for the gloom that went before . Grand masses of cloud were hurried across the blue , and the great round hills behind the Chase seemed alive with their flying shadows ; the sun was hidden for a moment , and then shone out warm again like a recovered joy ; the leaves , still green , were tossed off the hedgerow trees by the wind ; around the farmhouses there was a sound of clapping doors ; the apples fell in the orchards ; and the stray horses on the green sides of the lanes and on the common had their manes blown about their faces . And yet the wind seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun was shining . A merry day for the	1860
to answer . Arthur was in the wretched position of an open , generous man who has committed an error which makes deception seem a necessity . The native impulse to give truth in return for truth , to meet trust with frank confession , must be suppressed , and duty was becoming a question of tactics . His deed was reacting upon him—was already governing him tyrannously and forcing him into a course that jarred with his habitual feelings . The only aim that seemed admissible to him now was to deceive Adam to the utmost : to make Adam think better of him than he deserved . And when he heard the words of honest retractation—when he heard the sad appeal with which Adam ended—he was obliged to rejoice in	1860
. He won ’ t bring the other people in Hayslope round to his opinion , while you go on singing as well as you do. ” “ Yes , sir , but it turns a man ’ s stomach t ’ hear the Scripture misused i ’ that way . I know as much o ’ the words o ’ the Bible as he does , an ’ could say the Psalms right through i ’ my sleep if you was to pinch me ; but I know better nor to take ’ em to say my own say wi ’ . I might as well take the Sacriment-cup home and use it at meals. ” “ That ’ s a very sensible remark of yours , Joshua ; but , as I said before—— ” While Mr. Irwine was speaking , the	1860
well ; it was the boundary mark of his youth—the sign , to him , of the time when some of his earliest , strongest feelings had left him . He felt sure they would never return . And yet , at this moment , there was a stirring of affection at the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago . It was affection for the dead : _that_ Arthur existed no longer . He was disturbed by the sound of approaching footsteps , but the beech stood at a turning in the road , and he could not	1860
holding the baby to relieve his wife , and the big soft-hearted man had rubbed away some tears with his fist , with a confused intention of being a better fellow , going less to the Holly Bush down by the Stone-pits , and cleaning himself more regularly of a Sunday . In front of Sandy Jim stood Chad ’ s Bess , who had shown an unwonted quietude and fixity of attention ever since Dinah had begun to speak . Not that the matter of the discourse had arrested her at once , for she was lost in a puzzling speculation as to what pleasure and satisfaction there could be in life to a young woman who wore a	1860
gentlemen think of girls who cried in that way ? She felt unable even to say “ no , ” but could only look away from him and wipe the tears from her cheek . Not before a great drop had fallen on her rose-coloured strings—she knew that quite well . “ Come , be cheerful again . Smile at me , and tell me what ’ s the matter . Come , tell me. ” Hetty turned her head towards him , whispered , “ I thought you wouldn ’ t come , ” and slowly got courage to lift her eyes to him . That look was too much : he must have had eyes of Egyptian granite not to look too lovingly in return .	1860
Arthur , “ you and me ’ ll often be thinking o ’ the same thing , when we ’ re a long way off one another . I ’ ll pray God to help you , as I pray him to help me. ” “ But there ’ s that sweet woman—that Dinah Morris , ” Arthur said , pursuing his own thoughts and not knowing what had been the sense of Adam ’ s words , “ she says she shall stay with her to the very last moment—till she goes ; and the poor thing clings to her as if she found some comfort in her . I could worship that woman ; I don ’ t know what I should do if she were not there . Adam , you will see her when she comes back . I could say nothing to her	1860
of life . And if that handsome , generous-blooded clergyman , the Rev . Adolphus Irwine , had not had these two hopelessly maiden sisters , his lot would have been shaped quite differently : he would very likely have taken a comely wife in his youth , and now , when his hair was getting grey under the powder , would have had tall sons and blooming daughters—such possessions , in short , as men commonly think will repay them for all the labour they take under the sun . As it was—having with all his three livings no more than seven hundred a-year , and seeing no way of keeping his splendid mother and his sickly sister , not to reckon a second sister , who was usually spoken of without any adjective ,	1860
more brandy ? I can be there and back pretty soon . It ’ ll be a stiff walk home for you , if you don ’ t have something to revive you. ” “ Yes—go . But don ’ t say I ’ m ill . Ask for my man Pym , and tell him to get it from Mills , and not to say I ’ m at the Hermitage . Get some water too. ” Adam was relieved to have an active task—both of them were relieved to be apart from each other for a short time . But Adam ’ s swift pace could not still the eager pain of thinking—of living again with concentrated suffering through the last wretched hour , and looking out from it over all the new sad future . Arthur lay still for some minutes after Adam was gone ,	1860
quite voluntary ; he need not have gone—he would not have gone if he had wanted to see her . She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night ’ s vision was not to be fulfilled ; and in this moment of chill , bare , wintry disappointment and doubt , she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again , of meeting his loving glance , and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the “ growing pain ” of passion . Chapter XIX Adam on a Working Day Notwithstanding Mr. Craig ’ s prophecy , the dark-blue cloud dispersed itself without having produced the threatened consequences . “ The weather ” —as he observed the next morning— “ the weather , you see , ’ s a ticklish thing , an	1860
Bartle , rising , and taking off his spectacles , “ I ’ ll do that , I ’ ll do that ; though the mother ’ s a whimpering thing—I don ’ t like to come within earshot of her ; however , she ’ s a straight-backed , clean woman , none of your slatterns . I wish you good-bye , sir , and thank you for the time you ’ ve spared me . You ’ re everybody ’ s friend in this business—everybody ’ s friend . It ’ s a heavy weight you ’ ve got on your shoulders. ” “ Good-bye , Bartle , till we meet at Stoniton , as I daresay we shall. ” Bartle hurried away from the rectory , evading Carroll ’ s conversational advances , and	1860
the same colour as the hair , were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled ; the eyelashes , though no darker , were long and abundant—nothing was left blurred or unfinished . It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals . The eyes had no peculiar beauty , beyond that of expression ; they looked so simple , so candid , so gravely loving , that no accusing scowl , no light sneer could help melting away before their glance . Joshua Rann gave a long cough , as if he were clearing his throat in order to come to a new understanding with	1860
a-going i ’ nine months , and not for want o ’ talking to , neither—and what are you stanning there for , like a jack as is run down , instead o ’ getting your wheel out ? You ’ re a rare un for sitting down to your work a little while after it ’ s time to put by. ” “ Munny , my iron ’ s twite told ; pease put it down to warm. ” The small chirruping voice that uttered this request came from a little sunny-haired girl between three and four , who , seated on a high chair at the end of the ironing table , was arduously clutching the handle of a miniature iron with	1860
some o ’ your kin , as is mayhap cliverer. ” “ Seth , lad , ” said Adam , taking no notice of the sarcasm against himself , “ thee mustna take me unkind . I wasna driving at thee in what I said just now . Some ’ s got one way o ’ looking at things and some ’ s got another. ” “ Nay , nay , Addy , thee mean ’ st me no unkindness , ” said Seth , “ I know that well enough . Thee ’ t like thy dog Gyp—thee bark ’ st at me sometimes , but thee allays lick ’ st my hand after. ” All hands worked on in silence for some minutes , until the church clock began to strike six . Before the first stroke had died away , Sandy Jim had loosed his plane	1860
before he asked any of the young ones ; and the country-dances , and the stamping , and the gracious nodding , and the waving of the hands , went on joyously . At last the time had come for the fourth dance—longed for by the strong , grave Adam , as if he had been a delicate-handed youth of eighteen ; for we are all very much alike when we are in our first love ; and Adam had hardly ever touched Hetty ’ s hand for more than a transient greeting—had never danced with her but once before . His eyes had followed her eagerly to-night in spite of himself , and had taken in deeper draughts of love . He thought she behaved so prettily , so quietly ; she did not seem to be flirting at all , she smiled	1860
“ Do you feel any hurt inside sir ? ” Adam asked again “ No—no hurt , ” said Arthur , still faintly , “ but rather done up. ” After a while he said , “ I suppose I fainted away when you knocked me down. ” “ Yes , sir , thank God , ” said Adam . “ I thought it was worse. ” “ What ! You thought you ’ d done for me , eh ? Come help me on my legs. ” “ I feel terribly shaky and dizzy , ” Arthur said , as he stood leaning on Adam ’ s arm ; “ that blow of yours must have come against me like a battering-ram . I don ’ t believe I can walk alone. ” “ Lean on me , sir ; I ’ ll get you along , ” said	1860
, I ’ m not turnin ’ noway . I said nought about the women preachin ’ . I said , You let the Bible alone : you ’ ve got a jest-book , han ’ t you , as you ’ re rare and proud on ? Keep your dirty fingers to that. ” “ Why , y ’ are gettin ’ as big a saint as Seth . Y ’ are goin ’ to th ’ preachin ’ to-night , I should think . Ye ’ ll do finely t ’ lead the singin ’ . But I don ’ know what Parson Irwine ’ ull say at his gran ’ favright Adam Bede a-turnin ’ Methody. ” “ Never	1860
stinging you—they are poisoning your soul—they are dragging you down into a dark bottomless pit , where you will sink for ever , and for ever , and for ever , further away from light and God. ” Bessy could bear it no longer : a great terror was upon her , and wrenching her ear-rings from her ears , she threw them down before her , sobbing aloud . Her father , Chad , frightened lest he should be “ laid hold on ” too , this impression on the rebellious Bess striking him as nothing less than a miracle , walked hastily away	1860
days such as he lived through , with growing contentment and intensity of interest , every fresh week . Love , he thought , could never be anything to him but a living memory—a limb lopped off , but not gone from consciousness . He did not know that the power of loving was all the while gaining new force within him ; that the new sensibilities bought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was possible , nay , necessary to him , that his nature should intertwine with another . Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship	1860
” Without waiting for her to speak , he turned away from her and hurried back towards the road that led to the Hermitage , leaving Hetty to pursue her way in a strange dream that seemed to have begun in bewildering delight and was now passing into contrarieties and sadness . Would he meet her again as she came home ? Why had he spoken almost as if he were displeased with her ? And then run away so suddenly ? She cried , hardly knowing why . Arthur too was very uneasy , but his feelings were lit up for him by a more distinct consciousness . He hurried to the Hermitage , which stood in the heart of the	1860
’ ve talked to her for a hour on end , and scolded her too ; for she ’ s my own sister ’ s child , and it behoves me to do what I can for her . But eh , poor thing , as soon as she ’ d said us ‘ good-bye ’ an ’ got into the cart , an ’ looked back at me with her pale face , as is welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven , I begun to be frightened to think o ’ the set-downs I ’ d given her ; for it comes over	1860
aye , ” said Adam , striding along towards the streak of pale road . He was the only object moving on the wide common . The two grey donkeys , just visible in front of the gorse bushes , stood as still as limestone images—as still as the grey-thatched roof of the mud cottage a little farther on . Bartle kept his eye on the moving figure till it passed into the darkness , while Vixen , in a state of divided affection , had twice run back to the house to bestow a parenthetic lick on her puppies . “ Aye , aye , ” muttered the schoolmaster , as Adam disappeared , “ there you go , stalking along—stalking along ; but you wouldn ’ t have been what you are if you hadn ’	1860
, aye , I ’ m never to have a will o ’ my own any more . And those pups—what do you think I ’ m to do with ’ em , when they ’ re twice as big as you ? For I ’ m pretty sure the father was that hulking bull-terrier of Will Baker ’ s—wasn ’ t he now , eh , you sly hussy ? ” ( Here Vixen tucked her tail between her legs and ran forward into the house . Subjects are sometimes broached which a well-bred female will ignore . ) “ But where ’ s the use of talking to a woman with babbies ? ” continued Bartle . “ She ’ s got no conscience—no	1860
audience . She stooped now to gather up her sewing , and then went on with it as before . Mr. Irwine was deeply interested . He said to himself , “ He must be a miserable prig who would act the pedagogue here : one might as well go and lecture the trees for growing in their own shape. ” “ And you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your youth—that you are a lovely young woman on whom men ’ s eyes are fixed ? ” he said aloud . “ No , I ’ ve no room for such feelings , and I don ’	1860
he knocked on the door and said in his strong voice , “ Mrs . Poyser within ? ” “ Come in , Mr. Bede , come in , ” Mrs. Poyser called out from the dairy . She always gave Adam this title when she received him in her own house . “ You may come into the dairy if you will , for I canna justly leave the cheese. ” Adam walked into the dairy , where Mrs. Poyser and Nancy were crushing the first evening cheese . “ Why , you might think you war come to a dead-house , ” said Mrs. Poyser , as he stood in the open doorway ; “ they ’ re all i ’ the meadow ; but Martin ’ s sure to be in afore long , for they ’ re leaving the	1860
i ’ the parish . But a dreadful blow ’ s come upon me. ” Mr. Irwine started up from his chair , as if involuntarily , but then , determined to control himself , walked to the window and looked out . “ She ’ s gone away , sir , and we don ’ t know where . She said she was going to Snowfield o ’ Friday was a fortnight , and I went last Sunday to fetch her back ; but she ’ d never been there , and she took the coach to Stoniton , and beyond that I can ’ t trace her . But now I ’ m going a long journey to look for her , and I can ’ t trust t ’ anybody but you where I ’ m	1860
She was not afraid that Adam would tease her with love-making and flattering speeches like her other admirers ; he had always been so reserved to her ; she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave man loved her and was near her . It never entered into her mind that Adam was pitiable too—that Adam too must suffer one day . Hetty , we know , was not the first woman that had behaved more gently to the man who loved her in vain because she had herself begun to love another . It was a very old story , but Adam knew nothing about it , so he drank in the sweet delusion . “ That ’ ll do , ” said Hetty , after a little while . “ Aunt wants me to leave some	1860
“ nobody has ever heard me say Mr. Irwine was much of a preacher . He didn ’ t go into deep speritial experience ; and I know there ’ s a deal in a man ’ s inward life as you can ’ t measure by the square , and say , ‘ Do this and that ’ ll follow , ’ and , ‘ Do that and this ’ ll follow. ’ There ’ s things go on in the soul , and times when feelings come into you like a rushing mighty wind , as the Scripture says , and part your life in two a ’ most , so you look back on yourself as if you was somebody else . Those are things as you can ’ t bottle up in a ‘ do this ’ and ‘ do that ’	1860
quite round at the edges . Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge , where the light was strongest , and then opened it with her forefinger . The first words she looked at were those at the top of the left-hand page : “ And they all wept sore , and fell on Paul ’ s neck and kissed him. ” That was enough for Dinah ; she had opened on that memorable parting at Ephesus , when Paul had felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and warning . She hesitated no longer , but , opening her own door gently , went and tapped on Hetty ’ s . We	1860
morning , when the time will be short. ” Adam stood trembling , and at last sank down on his chair again . “ It won ’ t be , ” he said , “ it ’ ll be put off—there ’ ll perhaps come a pardon . Mr. Irwine said there was hope . He said , I needn ’ t quite give it up. ” “ That ’ s a blessed thought to me , ” said Dinah , her eyes filling with tears . “ It ’ s a fearful thing hurrying her soul away so fast. ” “ But let what will be , ” she added presently . “ You will surely come , and let	1860
” But to-day something prevented him from saying that , and he put out his hand to her in silence . Neither of them spoke , and yet both wished they could speak , as Adam entered , and they sat down . Dinah took the chair she had just left ; it was at the corner of the table near the window , and there was a book lying on the table , but it was not open . She had been sitting perfectly still , looking at the small bit of clear fire in the bright grate . Adam sat down opposite her , in Mr. Poyser ’ s three-cornered chair . “ Your mother is not ill again , I hope , Adam ? ” Dinah said , recovering herself .	1860
a strength of self-possession which is the sign that the last hope has departed . Despair no more leans on others than perfect contentment , and in despair pride ceases to be counteracted by the sense of dependence . Hetty felt that no one could deliver her from the evils that would make life hateful to her ; and no one , she said to herself , should ever know her misery and humiliation . No ; she would not confess even to Dinah . She would wander out of sight , and drown herself where her body would never be found , and	1860
the young squire ’ s coming into the estate had been robbed of all its pleasantness . To Arthur it was nothing surprising that the servants looked grave and sad : he himself was very much touched on seeing them all again , and feeling that he was in a new relation to them . It was that sort of pathetic emotion which has more pleasure than pain in it—which is perhaps one of the most delicious of all states to a good-natured man , conscious of the power to satisfy his good nature . His heart swelled agreeably as he said , “ Well , Mills , how is my aunt ? ” But now Mr. Bygate , the lawyer , who had	1860
Dinah had gone so early , she would perhaps already be near returning . The little , grey , desolate-looking hamlet , unscreened by sheltering trees , lay in sight long before he reached it , and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn . “ Perhaps that ’ s the last hymn before they come away , ” Adam thought . “ I ’ ll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her , farther off the village. ” He walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again , and seated himself on a loose stone , against the low wall , to watch till he should	1860

And she was just the same from the first o ’ my remembering her ; it made no difference in her , as I could see , when she took to the Methodists , only she talked a bit different and wore a different sort o ’ cap ; but she ’ d never in her life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent.	1860
courage , but in a tone of surprise , “ Why , ye ’ re a workin ’ woman ! ” “ Yes , I am Dinah Morris , and I work in the cotton-mill when I am at home. ” “ Ah ! ” said Lisbeth slowly , still wondering ; “ ye comed in so light , like the shadow on the wall , an ’ spoke i ’ my ear , as I thought ye might be a sperrit . Ye ’ ve got a ’ most the face o ’ one as is a-sittin ’ on the grave i ’ Adam ’ s new Bible. ” “ I come from the Hall Farm now .	1860
not inclined to talk , but there would not have been time to say much more , for they were now at the yard-gate . The still twilight , with its dying western red and its few faint struggling stars , rested on the farm-yard , where there was not a sound to be heard but the stamping of the cart-horses in the stable . It was about twenty minutes after sunset . The fowls were all gone to roost , and the bull-dog lay stretched on the straw outside his kennel , with the black-and-tan terrier by his side , when the falling-to of the gate disturbed them and set them barking , like good officials , before they had any distinct knowledge of the reason . The barking had its effect in the house , for , as Dinah	1860
near you . I trusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading for us both ; but it seems it was only meant for my trial . Perhaps I feel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature , for I often can ’ t help saying of you what the hymn says— In darkest shades if she appear , My dawning is begun ; She is my soul ’ s bright morning-star , And she my rising sun . That may be wrong , and I am to be taught better . But you wouldn ’ t be displeased with me if things	1860
what I ’ ll do beforehand , for the work often holds me longer than I expect . You ’ ll stay till the end o ’ the week , Dinah ? ” “ Yes , yes ! ” said Mr. Poyser . “ We ’ ll have no nay. ” “ She ’ s no call to be in a hurry , ” observed Mrs. Poyser . “ Scarceness o ’ victual ’ ull keep : there ’ s no need to be hasty wi ’ the cooking . An ’ scarceness is what there ’ s the biggest stock of i ’ that country. ” Dinah smiled , but gave no promise to stay , and	1860
as he strode towards the stables to give his orders about the horses . His own approbation was necessary to him , and it was not an approbation to be enjoyed quite gratuitously ; it must be won by a fair amount of merit . He had never yet forfeited that approbation , and he had considerable reliance on his own virtues . No young man could confess his faults more candidly ; candour was one of his favourite virtues ; and how can a man ’ s candour be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of ? But he had an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous kind—impetuous , warm-blooded , leonine ; never crawling , crafty ,	1860
possible : Mr. Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again along the Fir-tree Grove . That was the foreground of Hetty ’ s picture ; behind it lay a bright hazy something—days that were not to be as the other days of her life had been . It was as if she had been wooed by a river-god , who might any time take her to his wondrous halls below a watery heaven . There was no knowing what would come , since this strange entrancing delight had come . If a chest full of lace and satin and jewels had been sent her from some unknown source , how could she but have thought that her whole	1860
’ ll be no livin ’ i ’ th ’ village . For them Methodisses make folks believe as if they take a mug o ’ drink extry , an ’ make theirselves a bit comfortable , they ’ ll have to go to hell for ’ t as sure as they ’ re born . I ’ m not a tipplin ’ man nor a drunkard—nobody can say it on me—but I like a extry quart at Easter or Christmas time , as is nat ’ ral when we ’ re goin ’ the rounds a-singin ’ , an ’ folks offer ’ t you for nothin ’ ; or when I ’ m a-collectin ’ the dues ; an ’ I like a pint wi ’	1860
were all of a generous kind—impetuous , warm-blooded , leonine ; never crawling , crafty , reptilian . It was not possible for Arthur Donnithorne to do anything mean , dastardly , or cruel . “ No ! I ’ m a devil of a fellow for getting myself into a hobble , but I always take care the load shall fall on my own shoulders. ” Unhappily , there is no inherent poetical justice in hobbles , and they will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict their worst consequences on the prime offender , in spite of his loudly expressed wish . It was entirely owing to this deficiency in the scheme of things that Arthur had ever brought any one into trouble besides himself . He was nothing if not good-natured ; and all his pictures of the future ,	1860
great open space in front of the house , the games began . There were , of course , well-soaped poles to be climbed by the boys and youths , races to be run by the old women , races to be run in sacks , heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men , and a long list of challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of walking as many yards possible on one leg—feats in which it was generally remarked that Wiry Ben , being “ the lissom ’ st , springest fellow i ’ the country , ” was sure to	1860
was nearest to him , and was stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing entreaty . Hetty lifted her long dewy lashes , and met the eyes that were bent towards her with a sweet , timid , beseeching look . What a space of time those three moments were while their eyes met and his arms touched her ! Love is such a simple thing when we have only one-and-twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance , as if she were a bud first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning . Such young unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches that touch softly and are at rest ; they mingle as	1860
Christians . And as for spinning , why , you ’ ve wasted as much as your wage i ’ the flax you ’ ve spoiled learning to spin . And you ’ ve a right to feel that , and not to go about as gaping and as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody . Comb the wool for the whittaws , indeed ! That ’ s what you ’ d like to be doing , is it ? That ’ s the way with you—that ’ s the road you ’ d all like to go , headlongs to ruin . You ’ re never easy till you ’ ve got some sweetheart as is as big a fool as yourself : you think you ’ ll be finely off when you ’ re married , I daresay , and have got a three-legged	1860
if I were in the witness-box , narrating my experience on oath . Sixty years ago—it is a long time , so no wonder things have changed—all clergymen were not zealous ; indeed , there is reason to believe that the number of zealous clergymen was small , and it is probable that if one among the small minority had owned the livings of Broxton and Hayslope in the year , you would have liked him no better than you like Mr. Irwine . Ten to one , you would have thought him a tasteless , indiscreet , methodistical man . It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium required by our own enlightened opinions and refined taste ! Perhaps you will say , “ Do improve the facts a little , then ; make them more accordant with those correct views	1860
way to some shelter for the night . She had quite lost her way in the fields , and might as well go in one direction as another , for aught she knew . She walked through field after field , and no village , no house was in sight ; but _there_ , at the corner of this pasture , there was a break in the hedges ; the land seemed to dip down a little , and two trees leaned towards each other across the opening . Hetty ’ s heart gave a great beat as she thought there must be a pool there . She walked towards it heavily over the tufted grass , with pale lips and a sense of trembling . It was as if the thing were come in spite of	1860
Loamshire Militia ? A tall young officer with a fairish skin and reddish whiskers—and had a servant by the name o ’ Pym ? ” “ Oh yes , ” said Hetty ; “ you know him—where is he ? ” “ A fine sight o ’ miles away from here . The Loamshire Militia ’ s gone to Ireland ; it ’ s been gone this fortnight. ” “ Look there ! She ’ s fainting , ” said the landlady , hastening to support Hetty , who had lost her miserable consciousness and looked like a beautiful corpse . They carried her to the sofa and loosened her dress . “ Here ’ s a bad business , I suspect , ” said the landlord , as he brought in some water .	1860
likely to be flooded . But people who have pleasant homes get indoor enjoyments that they would never think of but for the rain . If it had not been a wet morning , Mr. Irwine would not have been in the dining-room playing at chess with his mother , and he loves both his mother and chess quite well enough to pass some cloudy hours very easily by their help . Let me take you into that dining-room and show you the Rev . Adolphus Irwine , Rector of Broxton , Vicar of Hayslope , and Vicar of Blythe , a pluralist at whom	1860
signs of the lifelong dreariness that was to follow it . Looking at the little trinkets which she had once eyed and fingered so fondly as the earnest of her future paradise of finery , she lived back in the moments when they had been given to her with such tender caresses , such strangely pretty words , such glowing looks , which filled her with a bewildering delicious surprise—they were so much sweeter than she had thought anything could be . And the Arthur who had spoken to her and looked at her in this way , who was present with her now—whose arm she felt round her , his cheek against hers , his very breath upon her—was the cruel , cruel Arthur who had written that letter , that letter which she snatched and crushed and	1860
she might make him understand she had forgiven his silence and coldness during the dance . He had never mentioned the locket to her again ; too happy that she smiled at him—still happier because he observed in her a more subdued air , something that he interpreted as the growth of womanly tenderness and seriousness . “ Ah ! ” he thought , again and again , “ she ’ s only seventeen ; she ’ ll be thoughtful enough after a while . And her aunt allays says how clever she is at the work . She ’ ll make a wife as Mother ’ ll have no occasion to grumble at , after all. ” To be sure , he had only seen her at home twice since the birthday ; for one Sunday , when he was intending to go from church to the	1860

She ’ s a perfect Hebe ; and if I were an artist , I would paint her . It ’ s amazing what pretty girls one sees among the farmers ’ daughters , when the men are such clowns .

The Green Man isn ’ t going to run away. ” “ Oh yes , I ’ ll be very glad if you ’ ll give me that , ” said Hetty , relieved at the thought that she would not have to go to the jeweller ’ s and be stared at and questioned	1860

She thought this coachman must know something about her . He must know Adam	1860
love of finery was just the thing that would most provoke his mother , and he himself disliked it as much as it was possible for him to dislike anything that belonged to her . “ Ah , ” he said , “ that ’ s like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase ; they ’ ve mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things i ’ their hair , but somehow I don ’ t like to see ’ em ; they allays put me i ’ mind o ’ the painted women outside the shows at Treddles ’ on Fair	1860
of the chamber where her husband lay dead . Throughout the day , except in her occasional outbursts of wailing grief , she had been in incessant movement , performing the initial duties to her dead with the awe and exactitude that belong to religious rites . She had brought out her little store of bleached linen , which she had for long years kept in reserve for this supreme use . It seemed but yesterday—that time so many midsummers ago , when she had told Thias where this linen lay , that he might be sure and reach it out for her when _she_ died , for she	1860
character , but was simply loud and startling , so that she felt uncertain whether she had interpreted it rightly . She rose and listened , but all was quiet afterwards , and she reflected that Hetty might merely have knocked something down in getting into bed . She began slowly to undress ; but now , owing to the suggestions of this sound , her thoughts became concentrated on Hetty—that sweet young thing , with life and all its trials before her—the solemn daily duties of the wife and mother—and her mind so unprepared for them all , bent merely on little foolish , selfish pleasures , like a child hugging its toys in the beginning of a long toilsome journey in which it will have to bear hunger and cold and unsheltered darkness .

She put it to her lips , and a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two swept away all fear . But her heart began to flutter strangely , and her hands to tremble as she broke the seal . She read slowly ; it was not easy for her to read a gentleman ’ s handwriting , though Arthur had taken pains to write plainly . “ DEAREST HETTY—I have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you , and I shall never forget our love .

her familiars , had long been the wife of Sandy Jim , and possessed a handsome set of matronly jewels , of which it is enough to mention the heavy baby she was rocking in her arms , and the sturdy fellow of five in knee-breeches , and red legs , who had a rusty milk-can round his neck by way of drum , and was very carefully avoided by Chad ’ s small terrier . This young olive-branch , notorious under the name of Timothy ’ s Bess ’ s Ben , being of an inquiring disposition , unchecked by any false modesty , had advanced beyond the group of women and children , and was walking round the Methodists , looking up in their faces with his mouth wide open , and beating his stick against the milk-can by way of musical accompaniment	1860
prices to calculating how many meals and how many rides were contained in her two guineas , and the odd shillings , which had a melancholy look , as if they were the pale ashes of the other bright-flaming coin . For the first few miles out of Stoniton , she walked on bravely , always fixing on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most distant visible point in the road as a goal , and feeling a faint joy when she had reached it . But when she came to the fourth milestone , the first she had happened to notice among the long grass by the roadside , and read that she was still only four miles beyond Stoniton , her courage sank . She had come only this little way , and	1860
walked by her side , timidly revolving something he wanted to say to her . It was an expression of unconscious placid gravity—of absorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment or with her own personality—an expression that is most of all discouraging to a lover . Her very walk was discouraging : it had that quiet elasticity that asks for no support . Seth felt this dimly ; he said to himself , “ She ’ s too good and holy for any man , let alone me , ” and the words he had been summoning rushed back again before they had reached his lips . But another thought gave him courage : “ There ’ s no man could love her better and leave her freer to follow the Lord ’ s work. ” They	1860

If it war summat I didna want , it ’ ud be done fast enough. ” Lisbeth rose from the bench at this , and went out of the workshop , leaving Seth in much anxiety lest she should disturb Adam ’ s mind about Dinah . He consoled himself after a time with reflecting that , since Adam ’ s trouble , Lisbeth had been very timid about speaking to him on matters of feeling , and that she would hardly dare to approach this tenderest of all subjects . Even if she	1860
, unhappy , discrowned , imprisoned ; but to-day all those shadows had fled , and not a soul in the vast hall felt the presence of any but a living sorrow , which was quivering in warm hearts . But that sorrow seemed to have made it itself feebly felt hitherto , now when Adam Bede ’ s tall figure was suddenly seen being ushered to the side of the prisoner ’ s dock . In the broad sunlight of the great hall , among the sleek shaven faces of other men , the marks of suffering in his face were startling even to Mr. Irwine , who had last seen him in the dim	1860
his master . Like all complaining women , she complained in the expectation of being soothed , and when Adam said nothing , she was only prompted to complain more bitterly . “ I know thee couldst do better wi ’ out me , for thee couldst go where thee likedst an ’ marry them as thee likedst . But I donna want to say thee nay , let thee bring home who thee wut ; I ’ d ne ’ er open my lips to find faut , for when folks is old an ’ o ’ no use , they may think theirsens well off to get the bit an ’ the sup , though they ’ n to swallow ill words wi ’ t . An	1860
helpless timid creature had some fellowship with her , and without being quite aware of the reason , she was less doubtful about speaking to the driver , who now came forward—a large ruddy man , with a sack over his shoulders , by way of scarf or mantle . “ Could you take me up in your waggon , if you ’ re going towards Ashby ? ” said Hetty . “ I ’ ll pay you for it. ” “ Aw , ” said the big fellow , with that slowly dawning smile which belongs to heavy faces , “ I can take y ’ up fawst enough wi ’ out bein ’ paid for ’ t if you dooant mind lyin ’ a bit closish a-top o ’	1860

There ’ s plenty of these big , lumbering fellows ’ ud never have known their A B C if it hadn ’ t been for Bartle Massey . Well , well , Vixen , you foolish wench , what is it , what is it ?

For I ’ m pretty sure the father was	1860
, and bolted the door behind her . _Now_ she would read her letter . It must—it must have comfort in it . How was Adam to know the truth ? It was always likely he should say what he did say . She set down the candle and took out the letter . It had a faint scent of roses , which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her . She put it to her lips , and a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two swept away all fear . But her heart began to flutter strangely , and her hands to tremble as she broke the seal . She read slowly ; it was not easy for her to read a gentleman ’ s handwriting , though Arthur had taken pains to write plainly .	1860

but I see plain enough we shall never do it without a resolution , and that ’ s enough for me. ” Adam , you perceive , was a warm admirer , perhaps a partial judge , of Mr. Irwine , as , happily , some of us still are of the people we have known familiarly . Doubtless it will be despised as a weakness by that lofty order of minds who pant after the ideal , and are oppressed by a general sense that their emotions are of too exquisite a character to find fit objects among their everyday fellowmen . I have often been favoured with the confidence of these select natures , and find them to concur	1860
“ Why , then , instead of acting like th ’ upright , honourable man we ’ ve all believed you to be , you ’ ve been acting the part of a selfish light-minded scoundrel . You know as well as I do what it ’ s to lead to when a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to a young woman like Hetty , and gives her presents as she ’ s frightened for other folks to see . And I say it again , you ’ re acting the part of a selfish light-minded scoundrel though it cuts me to th ’ heart	1860
had his hand on the door-latch , he could see , through the curtainless window , that there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks , lighted by thin dips . When he entered , a reading lesson was going forward and Bartle Massey merely nodded , leaving him to take his place where he pleased . He had not come for the sake of a lesson to-night , and his mind was too full of personal matters , too full of the last two hours he had passed in Hetty ’ s presence , for him to amuse himself with a book till school was over ; so he sat down in a corner and looked on with an absent mind . It was a sort of scene which Adam	1860
Monsieur Bournisien was there , and two large candles were burning at the head of the bed , that had been taken out of the alcove . The druggist , on whom the silence weighed , was not long before he began formulating some regrets about this “ unfortunate young woman. ” and the priest replied that there was nothing to do now but pray for her . “ Yet , ” Homais went on , “ one of two things ; either she died in a state of grace ( as the Church has it ) , and then she has no need of our prayers ; or else she departed impertinent ( that is , I believe , the ecclesiastical expression ) , and then -- ” Bournisien interrupted him , replying testily that it was none the less necessary to pray . “	1850
his full plate , and his napkin tied round his neck like a child , an old man sat eating , letting drops of gravy drip from his mouth . His eyes were bloodshot , and he wore a little queue tied with black ribbon . He was the Marquis ’ s father-in-law , the old Duke de Laverdiere , once on a time favourite of the Count d ’ Artois , in the days of the Vaudreuil hunting-parties at the Marquis de Conflans ’ , and had been , it was said , the lover of Queen Marie Antoinette , between Monsieur de Coigny and Monsieur de Lauzun . He had lived a life of	1850
flags ; he watched it drift along , and heard nothing but the throbbing in his head and the faint clucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the yard . Emma from time to time cooled her cheeks with the palms of her hands , and cooled these again on the knobs of the huge fire-dogs . She complained of suffering since the beginning of the season from giddiness ; she asked if sea-baths would do her any good ; she began talking of her convent , Charles of his school ; words came to them . They went up into her bedroom	1850
! ” “ And the master ’ ll soon be in. ” “ I know that well enough . Leave me alone. ” She had tried everything ; there was nothing more to be done now ; and when Charles came in she would have to say to him -- “ Go away ! This carpet on which you are walking is no longer ours . In your own house you do not possess a chair , a pin , a straw , and it is I , poor man , who have ruined you. ” Then there would be a great sob ; next he would weep abundantly , and at last , the surprise past , he would forgive her .	1850
opened her window overlooking the garden and watched the clouds . They gathered around the sunset on the side of Rouen and then swiftly rolled back their black columns , behind which the great rays of the sun looked out like the golden arrows of a suspended trophy , while the rest of the empty heavens was white as porcelain . But a gust of wind bowed the poplars , and suddenly the rain fell ; it pattered against the green leaves . Then the sun reappeared , the hens clucked , sparrows shook their wings in the damp thickets , and the pools of water on the gravel as they flowed away carried off the pink flowers of an acacia . “ Ah ! how far off he must be already ! ” she thought .	1850
, the manchineel , vipers . “ I have even read that various persons have found themselves under toxicological symptoms , and , as it were , thunderstricken by black-pudding that had been subjected to a too vehement fumigation . At least , this was stated in a very fine report drawn up by one of our pharmaceutical chiefs , one of our masters , the illustrious Cadet de Gassicourt ! ” Madame Homais reappeared , carrying one of those shaky machines that are heated with spirits of wine ; for Homais liked to make his coffee at table , having , moreover , torrefied it , pulverised it , and mixed it himself . “ Saccharum	1850
out after vespers ; the crowd flowed out through the three doors like a stream through the three arches of a bridge , and in the middle one , more motionless than a rock , stood the beadle . Then she remembered the day when , all anxious and full of hope , she had entered beneath this large nave , that had opened out before her , less profound than her love ; and she walked on weeping beneath her veil , giddy , staggering , almost fainting . “ Take care ! ” cried a voice issuing from the gate of a courtyard that was thrown open . She	1850
, began to talk to him of her troubles : he was neglecting her , he loved another . She had been warned she would be unhappy ; and she ended by asking him for a dose of medicine and a little more love . Chapter Two One night towards eleven o ’ clock they were awakened by the noise of a horse pulling up outside their door . The servant opened the garret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below . He came for the doctor , had a letter for him . Natasie came downstairs shivering and undid the bars and bolts one after the other . The man left his horse , and , following the servant , suddenly came in behind her . He pulled out from his wool	1850
to drive into Rouen , drawn by an English horse and driven by a groom in top-boots . It was Justin who had inspired her with this whim , by begging her to take him into her service as _valet-de-chambre_ , [ 19 ] and if the privation of it did not lessen the pleasure of her arrival at each rendezvous , it certainly augmented the bitterness of the return .

Often , when they talked together of Paris , she ended by murmuring , “ Ah ! how happy we should be there ! ” “ Are we not happy ? ” gently answered the young man passing his hands over her hair . “ Yes , that is true , ” she said . “ I am	1850
“ The outings at restaurants , the masked balls , the champagne -- all that ’ ll be jolly enough , I assure you. ” “ I don ’ t think he ’ ll go wrong , ” objected Bovary . “ Nor do I , ” said Monsieur Homais quickly ; “ although he ’ ll have to do like the rest for fear of passing for a Jesuit . And you don ’ t know what a life those dogs lead in the Latin quarter with actresses . Besides , students are thought a great deal of in Paris .

The curtains were in red levantine , that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too much towards the bell-shaped bedside ; and nothing in the world was so lovely as her brown head and white skin standing out against this purple colour , when , with a movement of shame , she crossed her bare arms , hiding her face in her hands . The warm room , with its discreet carpet , its gay ornaments , and its calm light , seemed made for the intimacies of passion . The curtain-rods , ending in arrows , their brass pegs , and the great balls of the fire-dogs shone suddenly when the sun came in . On the	1850

A cat slowly walking over some roof put up his back in the pale rays of the sun . The wind on the highroad blew up clouds of dust . Afar off a dog sometimes howled ; and the bell , keeping time , continued its monotonous ringing that died away over the fields . But the people came out from church . The women in waxed clogs , the peasants in new blouses	1850

Emma , filled with disgust , threw him over her shoulder a five-franc piece . It was all her fortune . It seemed to her very fine thus to throw it away . The coach had gone on again when suddenly Monsieur Homais leant out through the window , crying -- “ No farinaceous	1850
You are all evil ! ” One day , as they were talking philosophically of earthly disillusions , to experiment on his jealousy , or yielding , perhaps , to an over-strong need to pour out her heart , she told him that formerly , before him , she had loved someone . “ Not like you , ” she went on quickly , protesting by the head of her child that “ nothing had passed between them. ” The young man believed her , but none the less questioned her to find out what he was . “ He was a ship ’ s captain ,	1850

A large porcelain stove crackled beneath a cactus that filled up the niche in the wall , and in black wood frames against the oak-stained paper hung Steuben ’ s “ Esmeralda ” and Schopin ’ s “ Potiphar. ” The ready-laid table , the two silver chafing-dishes , the crystal door-knobs , the parquet and the furniture , all shone with a scrupulous , English cleanliness ; the windows were ornamented at each corner with stained glass	1850
virtue . The church like a huge boudoir spread around her ; the arches bent down to gather in the shade the confession of her love ; the windows shone resplendent to illumine her face , and the censers would burn that she might appear like an angel amid the fumes of the sweet-smelling odours . But she did not come . He sat down on a chair , and his eyes fell upon a blue stained window representing boatmen carrying baskets . He looked at it long , attentively , and he counted the scales of the fishes and the button-holes of	1850
to go there. ” She dressed , put on her black gown , and her hood with jet beads , and that she might not be seen ( there was still a crowd on the Place ) , she took the path by the river , outside the village . She reached the notary ’ s gate quite breathless . The sky was sombre , and a little snow was falling . At the sound of the bell , Theodore in a red waistcoat appeared on the steps ; he came to open the door almost familiarly , as to an acquaintance , and showed her into the dining-room . A large porcelain stove crackled beneath a cactus that filled up the niche in the wall , and in black wood frames against the oak-stained paper hung Steuben ’ s “ Esmeralda ” and Schopin	1850
hole at the lower part of her face ; her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands ; a kind of white dust besprinkled her lashes , and her eyes were beginning to disappear in that viscous pallor that looks like a thin web , as if spiders had spun it over . The sheet sunk in from her breast to her knees , and then rose at the tips of her toes , and it seemed to Charles that infinite masses , an enormous load , were weighing upon her . The church clock struck two	1850
catastrophe that would bring about their separation , since she had not the courage to make up her mind to it herself . She none the less went on writing him love letters , in virtue of the notion that a woman must write to her lover . But whilst she wrote it was another man she saw , a phantom fashioned out of her most ardent memories , of her finest reading , her strongest lusts , and at last he became so real , so tangible , that she palpitated wondering , without , however , the power to imagine him clearly , so lost was he , like a god , beneath the abundance of his attributes . He dwelt in that azure land where silk ladders hang from balconies	1850
and there with a straw mat bearing beneath it the words in large letters , “ Mr . So-and-so ’ s pew. ” Farther on , at a spot where the building narrows , the confessional forms a pendant to a statuette of the Virgin , clothed in a satin robe , coifed with a tulle veil sprinkled with silver stars , and with red cheeks , like an idol of the Sandwich Islands ; and , finally , a copy of the “ Holy Family , presented by the Minister of the Interior , ” overlooking the high altar , between four candlesticks , closes in the perspective . The choir stalls , of deal wood , have been left unpainted . The market , that is to say , a tiled roof supported by some twenty posts , occupies of itself	1850
, on end and their shafts in the air , spread all along the line of houses from the church to the inn . On the other side there were canvas booths , where cotton checks , blankets , and woollen stockings were sold , together with harness for horses , and packets of blue ribbon , whose ends fluttered in the wind . The coarse hardware was spread out on the ground between pyramids of eggs and hampers of cheeses , from which sticky straw stuck out . Near the corn-machines clucking hens passed their necks through the bars of flat cages . The people , crowding in the same place and unwilling to move thence , sometimes threatened to smash the shop front of the chemist . On	1850
he replied ; “ but she wants to see the account. ” The next morning at daybreak Emma ran to Lheureux to beg him to make out another account for not more than a thousand francs , for to show the one for four thousand it would be necessary to say that she had paid two-thirds , and confess , consequently , the sale of the estate -- a negotiation admirably carried out by the shopkeeper , and which , in fact , was only actually known later on . Despite the low price of each article , Madame Bovary senior , of course , thought the expenditure extravagant . “	1850
the poison , railed at it , and implored it to be quick , and thrust away with her stiffened arms everything that Charles , in more agony than herself , tried to make her drink . He stood up , his handkerchief to his lips , with a rattling sound in his throat , weeping , and choked by sobs that shook his whole body . Félicité was running hither and thither in the room . Homais , motionless , uttered great sighs ; and Monsieur Canivet , always retaining his self-command , nevertheless began to feel uneasy . “ The devil ! yet she has been purged , and from the moment that the cause ceases -- ” “ The effect must cease , ” said Homais , “ that is evident. ” “ Oh , save her ! ” cried	1850
of animal charcoal , if you please , to clean the varnished leather of my togs. ” The druggist was beginning to cut the wax when Madame Homais appeared , Irma in her arms , Napoleon by her side , and Athalie following . She sat down on the velvet seat by the window , and the lad squatted down on a footstool , while his eldest sister hovered round the jujube box near her papa . The latter was filling funnels and corking phials , sticking on labels , making up parcels . Around him all were silent ; only from time to time , were heard the weights jingling in the balance , and a few	1850
, “ have fallen from the old box of bills that is on the edge of the shelf. ” From that moment her existence was but one long tissue of lies , in which she enveloped her love as in veils to hide it . It was a want , a mania , a pleasure carried to such an extent that if she said she had the day before walked on the right side of a road , one might know she had taken the left . One morning , when she had gone , as usual , rather lightly clothed , it suddenly began to snow , and as Charles was watching the weather from	1850
good of playing ? Who would hear her ? Since she could never , in a velvet gown with short sleeves , striking with her light fingers the ivory keys of an Erard at a concert , feel the murmur of ecstasy envelop her like a breeze , it was not worth while boring herself with practicing . Her drawing cardboard and her embroidery she left in the cupboard . What was the good ? What was the good ? Sewing irritated her . “ I have read everything , ” she said to herself . And she sat there making the tongs red-hot , or looked at the rain falling . How sad she was on Sundays when vespers sounded ! She listened with dull attention to each stroke of the cracked bell . A cat slowly walking over some roof put up his back in the pale rays	1850
he did not insist . Then to explain his visit he said that his ploughman , the man of the blood-letting , still suffered from giddiness . “ I ’ ll call around , ” said Bovary . “ No , no ! I ’ ll send him to you ; we ’ ll come ; that will be more convenient for you. ” “ Ah ! very good ! I thank you. ” And as soon as they were alone , “ Why don ’ t you accept Monsieur Boulanger ’ s kind offer ? ” She assumed a sulky air , invented a thousand excuses , and finally declared that perhaps it would look odd . “ Well , what the deuce do I care for that ? ” said Charles , making a pirouette . “ Health before everything ! You are wrong. ” “ And how	1850
really sorry , ” said Bovary , “ about the money which you are -- ” The other made a careless gesture full of cordiality , and taking his hat said -- “ It is settled , isn ’ t it ? To-morrow at six o ’ clock ? ” Charles explained once more that he could not absent himself longer , but that nothing prevented Emma -- “ But , ” she stammered , with a strange smile , “ I am not sure -- ” “ Well , you must think it over . We ’ ll see . Night	1850
nothing forced her to go ; but she had given her word that she would return that same evening . Moreover , Charles expected her , and in her heart she felt already that cowardly docility that is for some women at once the chastisement and atonement of adultery . She packed her box quickly , paid her bill , took a cab in the yard , hurrying on the driver , urging him on , every moment inquiring about the time and the miles traversed . He succeeded in catching up the “ Hirondelle ” as it neared the first houses of Quincampoix . Hardly was she seated in her corner than she closed her eyes , and opened them at the foot of the hill , when from afar she recognised Félicité , who was on the lookout in front	1850
once more lost in the long line of white veils , marked off here and there by the stuff black hoods of the good sisters bending over their prie-Dieu . At mass on Sundays , when she looked up , she saw the gentle face of the Virgin amid the blue smoke of the rising incense . Then she was moved ; she felt herself weak and quite deserted , like the down of a bird whirled by the tempest , and it was unconsciously that she went towards the church , included to no matter what devotions , so that her soul was absorbed and all existence lost in it . On the Place she met Lestivoudois on his way	1850
liked , if only for the winter , to live in town , although the length of the fine days made the country perhaps even more wearisome in the summer . And , according to what she was saying , her voice was clear , sharp , or , on a sudden all languor , drawn out in modulations that ended almost in murmurs as she spoke to herself , now joyous , opening big naive eyes , then with her eyelids half closed , her look full of boredom , her thoughts wandering . Going home at night , Charles went over her words one by one , trying to recall them , to fill out their sense , that he might piece out the life she had lived before he knew her . But he never saw her in his thoughts other	1850

and that an ordered regimen of exquisite nurture maintains at its best . Their necks moved easily in their low cravats , their long whiskers fell over their turned-down collars , they wiped their lips upon handkerchiefs with embroidered initials that gave forth a subtle perfume . Those who were beginning to grow old had an air of youth , while there was something mature in the faces of the young . In their unconcerned looks was the calm of passions daily satiated , and through all their gentleness of manner pierced that peculiar brutality , the result of a command of half-easy things , in which force is exercised and	1850

Old Rouault said that he could not have been cured better by the first doctor of Yvetot , or even of Rouen . As to Charles , he did not stop to ask himself why it was a pleasure to him to go to the Bertaux . Had he done so , he would , no doubt , have attributed his zeal to the importance of the case , or perhaps to the money he hoped to make by it . Was it for this , however	1850

And so I should by no means recommend to you , my dear friend , any of those so-called remedies that , under the pretence of attacking the symptoms , attack the constitution . No ; no useless physicking ! Diet , that is all ; sedatives , emollients , dulcification . Then , don ’ t you think that perhaps her imagination should be worked upon ? ” “ In what way ? How ? ” said Bovary . “ Ah ! that is it . Such is indeed the question . ‘ That is the question , ’ as I lately read in a newspaper. ” But Emma , awaking , cried out -- “ The letter !	1850
worn off by contact with his gay companions , and he returned to the provinces despising everyone who had not with varnished shoes trodden the asphalt of the boulevards . By the side of a Parisienne in her laces , in the drawing-room of some illustrious physician , a person driving his carriage and wearing many orders , the poor clerk would no doubt have trembled like a child ; but here , at Rouen , on the harbour , with the wife of this small doctor he felt at his ease , sure beforehand he would shine . Self-possession depends on its environment . We don ’ t	1850
? ” she said , pushing her with her elbow . Berthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle , cutting her cheek , which began to bleed , against it . Madame Bovary sprang to lift her up , broke the bell-rope , called for the servant with all her might , and she was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared . It was the dinner-hour ; he had come home . “ Look , dear ! ” said Emma , in a calm voice , “ the little one fell down while she was playing , and has hurt herself. ” Charles reassured her ; the case was not a serious one , and he went for some sticking plaster . Madame Bovary did not go downstairs to the dining-room ; she wished to	1850
. Where could she be ? He sent Félicité to Homais , to Monsieur Tuvache , to Lheureux , to the “ Lion d ’ Or , ” everywhere , and in the intervals of his agony he saw his reputation destroyed , their fortune lost , Berthe ’ s future ruined . By what ? -- Not a word ! He waited till six in the evening . At last , unable to bear it any longer , and fancying she had gone to Rouen , he set out along the highroad , walked a mile , met no one , again waited , and returned home . She had come back . “ What was the matter ? Why ? Explain to me.	1850
? She could have wished this name of Bovary , which was hers , had been illustrious , to see it displayed at the booksellers ’ , repeated in the newspapers , known to all France . But Charles had no ambition . An Yvetot doctor whom he had lately met in consultation had somewhat humiliated him at the very bedside of the patient , before the assembled relatives . When , in the evening , Charles told her this anecdote , Emma inveighed loudly against his colleague . Charles was much touched . He kissed her forehead with a tear in his eyes . But she was angered with shame ; she	1850
he was glad to see her at last manifest a wish of any kind . As she grew stronger she displayed more wilfulness . First , she found occasion to expel Mere Rollet , the nurse , who during her convalescence had contracted the habit of coming too often to the kitchen with her two nurslings and her boarder , better off for teeth than a cannibal . Then she got rid of the Homais family , successively dismissed all the other visitors , and even frequented church less assiduously , to the great approval of the druggist , who said to her in a friendly way -- “ You were going in a bit for the cassock !	1850
, a voice which lingered , and in silence she heard it mingling like music with the last pulsations of her throbbing nerves . Rodolphe , a cigar between his lips , was mending with his penknife one of the two broken bridles . They returned to Yonville by the same road . On the mud they saw again the traces of their horses side by side , the same thickets , the same stones to the grass ; nothing around them seemed changed ; and yet for her something had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved in their places . Rodolphe now and again bent forward and took her hand to kiss it . She was charming on horseback -- upright , with her slender waist , her knee bent on the mane of her horse , her face somewhat flushed by	1850
went on . “ You look out , Riboudet , ” cried the priest in an angry voice ; “ I ’ ll warm your ears , you imp ! ” Then turning to Emma , “ He ’ s Boudet the carpenter ’ s son ; his parents are well off , and let him do just as he pleases . Yet he could learn quickly if he would , for he is very sharp . And so sometimes for a joke I call him Riboudet ( like the road one takes to go to Maromme ) and I even say ‘ Mon Riboudet. ’ Ha ! Ha ! ‘ Mont Riboudet. ’ The other day I repeated that just to Monsignor , and he	1850
of powdered sugar and lump sugar , of the scales on the table , and of the pans on the fire , she saw all the Homais , small and large , with aprons reaching to their chins , and with forks in their hands . Justin was standing up with bowed head , and the chemist was screaming -- “ Who told you to go and fetch it in the Capharnaum. ” “ What is it ? What is the matter ? ” “ What is it ? ” replied the druggist . “ We are making preserves ; they are simmering ; but they were about to boil over , because there is too much juice , and I ordered another pan . Then he , from	1850
he said -- “ It is Mademoiselle Lempereur , isn ’ t it , who gives you lessons ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Well , I saw her just now , ” Charles went on , “ at Madame Liegeard ’ s . I spoke to her about you , and she doesn ’ t know you. ” This was like a thunderclap . However , she replied quite naturally -- “ Ah ! no doubt she forgot my name. ” “ But perhaps , ” said the doctor , “ there are several Demoiselles Lempereur at Rouen who are music-mistresses. ” “ Possibly ! ” Then quickly -- “ But I have my receipts here . See ! ” And she went to the writing-table , ransacked all the drawers , rummaged the papers , and	1850
Monsieur Bournisien ! Thus consider the greater part of Voltaire ’ s tragedies ; they are cleverly strewn with philosophical reflections , that made them a vast school of morals and diplomacy for the people. ” [ 16 ] It corrects customs through laughter . “ I , ” said Binet , “ once saw a piece called the ‘ Gamin de Paris , ’ in which there was the character of an old general that is really hit off to a T. He sets down a young swell who had seduced a working girl , who at the ending -- ” “ Certainly , ” continued Homais , “ there is bad literature as there is bad pharmacy , but to condemn in a lump the most important of the fine arts seems to me a stupidity , a Gothic idea , worthy of the abominable times that	1850
-- “ Such is life ! ” “ Has life , ” Emma went on , “ been good to you at least , since our separation ? ” “ Oh , neither good nor bad. ” “ Perhaps it would have been better never to have parted. ” “ Yes , perhaps. ” “ You think so ? ” she said , drawing nearer , and she sighed . “ Oh , Rodolphe ! if you but knew ! I loved you so ! ” It was then that she took his hand , and they remained some time , their fingers intertwined , like that first day at the Show .	1850
keep himself in countenance , took up a water-bottle on the whatnot to water the geraniums . “ Ah ! thanks , ” said Charles ; “ you are good. ” But he did not finish , choking beneath the crowd of memories that this action of the druggist recalled to him . Then to distract him , Homais thought fit to talk a little horticulture : plants wanted humidity . Charles bowed his head in sign of approbation . “ Besides , the fine days will soon be here again. ” “ Ah ! ” said Bovary . The druggist , at his wit ’ s end , began softly to draw aside the small window-curtain . “ Hallo ! there ’ s Monsieur Tuvache passing. ” Charles repeated like a machine -- - “ Monsieur Tuvache passing !	1850
what an abyss I was dragging you , poor angel ? No , you do not , do you ? You were coming confident and fearless , believing in happiness in the future . Ah ! unhappy that we are -- insensate ! ” Rodolphe stopped here to think of some good excuse . “ If I told her all my fortune is lost ? No ! Besides , that would stop nothing . It would all have to be begun over again later on . As if one could make women like that listen to reason ! ” He	1850
asked if sea-baths would do her any good ; she began talking of her convent , Charles of his school ; words came to them . They went up into her bedroom . She showed him her old music-books , the little prizes she had won , and the oak-leaf crowns , left at the bottom of a cupboard . She spoke to him , too , of her mother , of the country , and even showed him the bed in the garden where , on the first Friday of every month , she gathered flowers to put on her mother ’ s tomb . But the gardener they had never knew anything about it ; servants are so stupid ! She would have dearly liked , if only for the winter , to live in town , although the length of the fine days	1850
dab fish and never said a word. ” “ Yes , ” observed the chemist ; “ no imagination , no sallies , nothing that makes the society-man. ” “ Yet they say he has parts , ” objected the landlady . “ Parts ! ” replied Monsieur Homais ; “ he , parts ! In his own line it is possible , ” he added in a calmer tone . And he went on -- “ Ah ! That a merchant , who has large connections , a jurisconsult , a doctor , a chemist , should be thus absent-minded , that they should become whimsical or even peevish , I can understand ; such cases are cited in history . But at least it is because they are thinking of something . Myself , for example , how often has it happened to me to look on the	1850
with pale little spots . It was a handkerchief of hers . Once when they were walking her nose had bled ; he had forgotten it . Near it , chipped at all the corners , was a miniature given him by Emma : her toilette seemed to him pretentious , and her languishing look in the worst possible taste . Then , from looking at this image and recalling the memory of its original , Emma ’ s features little by little grew confused in his remembrance , as if the living and the painted face , rubbing one against the other , had effaced each other . Finally , he read some of her letters ; they were full of explanations relating to their journey , short , technical , and urgent , like business notes	1850
conventional , that of men , that which constantly changes , that brays out so loudly , that makes such a commotion here below , of the earth earthly , like the mass of imbeciles you see down there . But the other , the eternal , that is about us and above , like the landscape that surrounds us , and the blue heavens that give us light. ” Monsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his mouth with a pocket-handkerchief . He continued -- “ And what should I do here gentlemen , pointing out to you the uses of agriculture ? Who supplies our wants ? Who provides our means of subsistence ? Is it not the agriculturist ? The agriculturist , gentlemen , who , sowing with laborious hand the fertile furrows of the country	1850
cured her . The priest did not fail to point this out ; he even explained to Bovary that the Lord sometimes prolonged the life of persons when he thought it meet for their salvation ; and Charles remembered the day when , so near death , she had received the communion . Perhaps there was no need to despair , he thought . In fact , she looked around her slowly , as one awakening from a dream ; then in a distinct voice she asked for her looking-glass , and remained some time bending over it , until the big tears fell from her eyes .	1850
delight that he accepted the landlady ’ s suggestion that he should dine in company with the newcomers , and they passed into the large parlour where Madame Lefrancois , for the purpose of showing off , had had the table laid for four . Homais asked to be allowed to keep on his skull-cap , for fear of coryza ; then , turning to his neighbour -- “ Madame is no doubt a little fatigued ; one gets jolted so abominably in our ‘ Hirondelle. ’ ” “ That is true , ” replied Emma ; “ but moving about always amuses me . I like change of place. ” “ It is so	1850
, and after the goodnights , or rather good mornings , the guests of the château retired to bed . Charles dragged himself up by the balusters . His “ knees were going up into his body. ” He had spent five consecutive hours standing bolt upright at the card tables , watching them play whist , without understanding anything about it , and it was with a deep sigh of relief that he pulled off his boots . Emma threw a shawl over her shoulders , opened the window , and leant out . The night was dark ; some drops of rain were falling .	1850
had to stop to mend with some string the traces that had broken . But Charles , giving a last look to the harness , saw something on the ground between his horse ’ s legs , and he picked up a cigar-case with a green silk border and beblazoned in the centre like the door of a carriage . “ There are even two cigars in it , ” said he ; “ they ’ ll do for this evening after dinner. ” “ Why , do you smoke ? ” she asked . “ Sometimes , when I get a chance. ” He put his find	1850
Léon , playing the dilettante , began to talk music . He had seen Tambourini , Rubini , Persiani , Grisi , and , compared with them , Lagardy , despite his grand outbursts , was nowhere . [ 17 ] Oh beautiful angel , my Lucie . “ Yet , ” interrupted Charles , who was slowly sipping his rum-sherbet , “ they say that he is quite admirable in the last act . I regret leaving before the end , because it was beginning to amuse me. ” “ Why , ” said the clerk , “ he will soon give another performance. ” But Charles replied that they were going back next day . “ Unless , ” he added , turning to his wife , “ you would like to stay alone , kitten ? ” And changing his tactics at this	1850
to consult the doctor for a pain I have in my back . Well , good-bye , Madame Bovary . At your service ; your very humble servant. ” And he closed the door gently . Emma had her dinner served in her bedroom on a tray by the fireside ; she was a long time over it ; everything was well with her . “ How good I was ! ” she said to herself , thinking of the scarves . She heard some steps on the stairs . It was Léon . She got up and took from the chest of drawers the first pile of dusters to be hemmed . When he came in she seemed very busy . The conversation languished ; Madame Bovary gave it up every few minutes ,	1850
and the fences disappear ; a bundle of ferns swings under a window from the end of a broomstick ; there is a blacksmith ’ s forge and then a wheelwright ’ s , with two or three new carts outside that partly block the way . Then across an open space appears a white house beyond a grass mound ornamented by a Cupid , his finger on his lips ; two brass vases are at each end of a flight of steps ; scutcheons [ 9 ] blaze upon the door . It is the notary ’ s house , and the finest in the place . [ 9 ] The _panonceaux_ that have to be hung over the doors of notaries . The Church is on the other side of the street , twenty paces farther down , at the	1850
of food he left on his plate . To find out more about it she questioned the tax-collector . Binet answered roughly that he “ wasn ’ t paid by the police. ” All the same , his companion seemed very strange to him , for Léon often threw himself back in his chair , and stretching out his arms , complained vaguely of life . “ It ’ s because you don ’ t take enough recreation , ” said the collector . “ What recreation ? ” “ If I were you I ’ d have a lathe. ” “ But I don ’ t	1850
, “ Ah ! this is the end for me , do you see ! I saw my wife go , then my son , and now to-day it ’ s my daughter. ” He wanted to go back at once to Bertaux , saying that he could not sleep in this house . He even refused to see his granddaughter . “ No , no ! It would grieve me too much . Only you ’ ll kiss her many times for me . Good-bye ! you ’ re a good fellow ! And then I shall never forget that , ” he said , slapping his thigh . “ Never fear , you shall always have your turkey. ” But when he reached the top of the hill he turned back , as he had turned once before on the road of Saint-Victor when	1850
one of her letters . As they talked they explained more and more fully the motives of their sadness , working themselves up in their progressive confidence . But they sometimes stopped short of the complete exposition of their thought , and then sought to invent a phrase that might express it all the same . She did not confess her passion for another ; he did not say that he had forgotten her . Perhaps he no longer remembered his suppers with girls after masked balls ; and no doubt she did not recollect the rendezvous of old when she ran across the fields in the morning to her lover ’ s house . The noises of the town hardly reached them , and the room seemed small , as if on purpose to hem in their solitude more closely . Emma , in a dimity dressing-gown	1850
the superior maxilla , had hearts that trembled , hands that shook , minds so strained as Monsieur Bovary when he approached Hippolyte , his tenotome between his fingers . And as at hospitals , near by on a table lay a heap of lint , with waxed thread , many bandages -- a pyramid of bandages -- every bandage to be found at the druggist ’ s . It was Monsieur Homais who since morning had been organising all these preparations , as much to dazzle the multitude as to keep up his illusions . Charles pierced the skin ; a dry crackling was heard . The tendon was cut , the operation over . Hippolyte could not get	1850
she had been here a century or a moment , she sat down in a corner , closed her eyes , and stopped her ears . The gate grated ; she sprang up . Before she had spoken Mere Rollet said to her -- “ There is no one at your house ! ” “ What ? ” “ Oh , no one ! And the doctor is crying . He is calling for you ; they ’ re looking for you. ” Emma answered nothing . She gasped as she turned her eyes about her , while the peasant woman , frightened at her face , drew back instinctively , thinking her mad . Suddenly she struck her brow and uttered a cry ; for the thought of Rodolphe	1850
of a vague distress ; and through the ringing of the bells , the murmur of the trees , and the rumbling of the empty vehicle , it had a far-off sound that disturbed Emma . It went to the bottom of her soul , like a whirlwind in an abyss , and carried her away into the distances of a boundless melancholy . But Hivert , noticing a weight behind , gave the blind man sharp cuts with his whip . The thong lashed his wounds , and he fell back into the mud with a yell . Then the passengers in the “ Hirondelle ” ended by falling asleep , some with	1850
the druggist himself aided in the preparations , while Madame Homais was saying as she pulled together the strings of her jacket -- “ You must excuse us , sir , for in this poor place , when one hasn ’ t been told the night before -- ” “ Wine glasses ! ” whispered Homais . “ If only we were in town , we could fall back upon stuffed trotters. ” “ Be quiet ! Sit down , doctor ! ” He thought fit , after the first few mouthfuls , to give some details as to the catastrophe . “ We first had a feeling of siccity in the pharynx , then intolerable pains	1850
What ! ” said he . “ Do you not know that there are souls constantly tormented ? They need by turns to dream and to act , the purest passions and the most turbulent joys , and thus they fling themselves into all sorts of fantasies , of follies. ” Then she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has voyaged over strange lands , and went on -- “ We have not even this distraction , we poor women ! ” “ A sad distraction , for happiness isn ’ t found in it. ” “ But is it ever found ? ” she asked . “ Yes ; one day it comes	1850
“ Now how am I to sign ? ” he said to himself . “ ‘ Yours devotedly ? ’ No ! ‘ Your friend ? ’ Yes , that ’ s it. ” “ Your friend. ” He re-read his letter . He considered it very good . “ Poor little woman ! ” he thought with emotion . “ She ’ ll think me harder than a rock . There ought to have been some tears on this ; but I can ’ t cry ; it isn ’ t my fault. ” Then , having emptied some water into a glass , Rodolphe dipped his	1850
she affected a certain repugnance . But as he urged her to try , she resolutely began eating , while Charles opposite her sat motionless in a dejected attitude . Now and then he raised his head and gave her a long look full of distress . Once he sighed , “ I should have liked to see him again ! ” She was silent . At last , understanding that she must say something , “ How old was your father ? ” she asked . “ Fifty-eight. ” “ Ah ! ” And that was all . A quarter of an hour after he added , “ My poor mother ! what will become of her now ? ” She made a gesture that signified she did not know	1850
her irritation a sort of depraved pleasure , Léon made a step forward . The cold that made him pale seemed to add a more gentle languor to his face ; between his cravat and his neck the somewhat loose collar of his shirt showed the skin ; the lobe of his ear looked out from beneath a lock of hair , and his large blue eyes , raised to the clouds , seemed to Emma more limpid and more beautiful than those mountain-lakes where the heavens are mirrored . “ Wretched boy ! ” suddenly cried the chemist . And he ran to his son , who had just precipitated himself into a heap of lime in order to whiten his boots . At the reproaches with which he was being	1850
had uttered lies , that had curled with pride and cried out in lewdness ; then upon the hands that had delighted in sensual touches ; and finally upon the soles of the feet , so swift of yore , when she was running to satisfy her desires , and that would now walk no more . The cure wiped his fingers , threw the bit of cotton dipped in oil into the fire , and came and sat down by the dying woman , to tell her that she must now blend her sufferings with those of Jesus Christ and abandon herself to the divine mercy . Finishing his exhortations , he tried to	1850
the eyelids quite gently with the tips of his lips . “ Why , you have been crying ! What for ? ” She burst into tears . Rodolphe thought this was an outburst of her love . As she did not speak , he took this silence for a last remnant of resistance , and then he cried out -- “ Oh , forgive me ! You are the only one who pleases me . I was imbecile and cruel . I love you . I will love you always . What is it . Tell me ! ” He was kneeling by her . “ Well , I am ruined , Rodolphe ! You must lend me three thousand francs. ” “ But -- but -- ” said he , getting up slowly , while his face assumed	1850
wall and fell asleep . She escaped , smiling , palpitating , undressed . Rodolphe had a large cloak ; he wrapped her in it , and putting his arm round her waist , he drew her without a word to the end of the garden . It was in the arbour , on the same seat of old sticks where formerly Léon had looked at her so amorously on the summer evenings . She never thought of him now . The stars shone through the leafless jasmine branches . Behind them they heard the river flowing , and now	1850
t be eating your heart , I ’ ll open wide the outer shutter of the window against the wall ; you can see it from the back by leaning over the hedge. ” And he went off . Charles fastened his horse to a tree ; he ran into the road and waited . Half an hour passed , then he counted nineteen minutes by his watch . Suddenly a noise was heard against the wall ; the shutter had been thrown back ; the hook was still swinging . The next day by nine o ’ clock he was at the farm . Emma blushed as he entered , and she gave a little forced laugh to keep herself in countenance . Old Rouault embraced his future son-in-law . The discussion of money matters was put off ; moreover , there was	1850
four strokes were heard from the convent-clock . Four o ’ clock ! And it seemed to her that she had been there on that form an eternity . But an infinity of passions may be contained in a minute , like a crowd in a small space . Emma lived all absorbed in hers , and troubled no more about money matters than an archduchess . Once , however , a wretched-looking man , rubicund and bald , came to her house , saying he had been sent by Monsieur Vincart of Rouen . He took out the pins that held together the side-pockets of his long green overcoat , stuck them into his sleeve , and politely handed her a paper . It was a bill for seven hundred francs , signed by her , and which	1850
the waving of the fans , made the air more suffocating . Emma wanted to go out ; the crowd filled the corridors , and she fell back in her arm-chair with palpitations that choked her . Charles , fearing that she would faint , ran to the refreshment-room to get a glass of barley-water . He had great difficulty in getting back to his seat , for his elbows were jerked at every step because of the glass he held in his hands , and he even spilt three-fourths on the shoulders of a Rouen lady in short sleeves , who feeling the cold liquid running down to her loins , uttered cries like a peacock , as if she were being assassinated . Her husband , who was a	1850
was going back to see his lathe again . “ Perhaps you would not do ill , ” Homais said to him , “ to send one of your men , or to go yourself -- ” “ Leave me alone ! ” answered the tax-collector . “ It ’ s all right ! ” “ Do not be uneasy , ” said the druggist , when he returned to his friends . “ Monsieur Binet has assured me that all precautions have been taken . No sparks have fallen ; the pumps are full . Let us go to rest. ” “ Ma foi ! I want it , ” said Madame Homais , yawning at large . “ But never mind ; we ’ ve had a beautiful day for our	1850
! Wait for me , and keep an eye on the jars. ” When Justin , who was rearranging his dress , had gone , they talked for a little while about fainting-fits . Madame Bovary had never fainted . “ That is extraordinary for a lady , ” said Monsieur Boulanger ; “ but some people are very susceptible . Thus in a duel , I have seen a second lose consciousness at the mere sound of the loading of pistols. ” “ For my part , ” said the chemist , “ the sight of other people ’ s blood doesn ’ t affect me at all , but the mere thought of my own flowing would make me faint if I reflected upon it too much. ” Monsieur Boulanger , however	1850
, the fine pores of her fair skin , and even her eyelids , which she blinked now and again . A great red glow passed over her with the blowing of the wind through the half-open door . On the other side of the chimney a young man with fair hair watched her silently . As he was a good deal bored at Yonville , where he was a clerk at the notary ’ s , Monsieur Guillaumin , Monsieur Léon Dupuis ( it was he who was the second habitue of the “ Lion d ’ Or ” ) frequently put back his dinner-hour	1850
-- “ Ah ! Madame , enough ! enough ! ” The other went on lecturing her , predicting they would end in the workhouse . But it was Bovary ’ s fault . Luckily he had promised to destroy that power of attorney . “ What ? ” “ Ah ! he swore he would , ” went on the good woman . Emma opened the window , called Charles , and the poor fellow was obliged to confess the promise torn from him by his mother . Emma disappeared , then came back quickly , and majestically handed her a thick piece of paper . “ Thank you , ” said the old woman . And she threw the power of attorney into the fire . Emma began	1850
while she still kept looking towards the mantelpiece . “ Has nurse taken it ? ” she asked . And at this name , that carried her back to the memory of her adulteries and her calamities , Madame Bovary turned away her head , as at the loathing of another bitterer poison that rose to her mouth . But Berthe remained perched on the bed . “ Oh , how big your eyes are , mamma ! How pale you are ! how hot you are ! ” Her mother looked at her . “ I am frightened ! ” cried the child , recoiling . Emma took her hand to kiss it ; the child struggled . “ That will do . Take her away , ” cried Charles ,	1850
, “ as to pick up my fan that has fallen behind the sofa ? ” The gentleman bowed , and as he moved to stretch out his arm , Emma saw the hand of a young woman throw something white , folded in a triangle , into his hat . The gentleman , picking up the fan , offered it to the lady respectfully ; she thanked him with an inclination of the head , and began smelling her bouquet . After supper , where were plenty of Spanish and Rhine wines , soups _à la bisque_ and _au	1850
by black joists , a meagre pear-tree sometimes leans and the ground-floors have at their door a small swing-gate to keep out the chicks that come pilfering crumbs of bread steeped in cider on the threshold . But the courtyards grow narrower , the houses closer together , and the fences disappear ; a bundle of ferns swings under a window from the end of a broomstick ; there is a blacksmith ’ s forge and then a wheelwright ’ s , with two or three new carts outside that partly block the way . Then across an open space appears a white house beyond a grass mound ornamented by a Cupid , his finger on his lips ; two brass vases are at each end of a flight of steps ;	1850
traces of their horses side by side , the same thickets , the same stones to the grass ; nothing around them seemed changed ; and yet for her something had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved in their places . Rodolphe now and again bent forward and took her hand to kiss it . She was charming on horseback -- upright , with her slender waist , her knee bent on the mane of her horse , her face somewhat flushed by the fresh air in the red of the evening . On entering Yonville she made her horse prance in the road . People looked at her from the windows . At dinner her husband thought she looked well , but she pretended not to	1850
did not answer , but as she sewed she pricked her fingers , which she then put to her mouth to suck them . Charles was surprised at the whiteness of her nails . They were shiny , delicate at the tips , more polished than the ivory of Dieppe , and almond-shaped . Yet her hand was not beautiful , perhaps not white enough , and a little hard at the knuckles ; besides , it was too long , with no soft inflections in the outlines . Her real beauty was in her eyes . Although brown , they seemed black because of the lashes , and her look came at you frankly , with a candid boldness . The bandaging over , the	1850
. Did he suspect anything ? She was lost in all kinds of apprehensions . At last , however , he went on -- “ We made it up , all the same , and I ’ ve come again to propose another arrangement. ” This was to renew the bill Bovary had signed . The doctor , of course , would do as he pleased ; he was not to trouble himself , especially just now , when he would have a lot of worry . “ And he would do better to give it over to someone else -- to you , for	1850
though wide open , they seemed slightly puckered by the cheek-bones , because of the blood pulsing gently under the delicate skin . A pink line ran along the partition between her nostrils . Her head was bent upon her shoulder , and the pearl tips of her white teeth were seen between her lips . “ Is she making fun of me ? ” thought Rodolphe . Emma ’ s gesture , however , had only been meant for a warning ; for Monsieur Lheureux was accompanying them , and spoke now and again as if to enter into the conversation . “ What a superb day ! Everybody is out ! The wind is east ! ” And neither Madame Bovary nor Rodolphe answered him , whilst at the slightest movement made by them he drew near , saying ,	1850
the orator painted those fierce times when men lived on acorns in the heart of woods . Then they had left off the skins of beasts , had put on cloth , tilled the soil , planted the vine . Was this a good , and in this discovery was there not more of injury than of gain ? Monsieur Derozerays set himself this problem . From magnetism little by little Rodolphe had come to affinities , and while the president was citing Cincinnatus and his plough , Diocletian , planting his cabbages , and the Emperors of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed , the young man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible attractions find their cause in some previous state of existence . “ Thus we	1850
so ! ” And congratulating himself at having surmounted the difficulty , Léon watched her face out of the corner of his eyes . It was like the sky when a gust of wind drives the clouds across . The mass of sad thoughts that darkened them seemed to be lifted from her blue eyes ; her whole face shone . He waited . At last she replied -- “ I always suspected it. ” Then they went over all the trifling events of that far-off existence , whose joys and sorrows they had just summed up in one word . They recalled the arbour with clematis , the dresses she had worn , the furniture of her room , the whole of her house . “ And our poor cactuses	1850
with the giving of the traces . “ Truly , ” said the druggist , “ one ought to proceed most rigorously against drunkenness ! I should like to see written up weekly at the door of the town hall on a board _ad hoc_ [ 13 ] the names of all those who during the week got intoxicated on alcohol . Besides , with regard to statistics , one would thus have , as it were , public records that one could refer to in case of need . But excuse me ! ” [ 13 ] Specifically for that . And he once	1850
. “ What ’ s the matter with Pere Tellier ? He coughs so that he shakes his whole house , and I ’ m afraid he ’ ll soon want a deal covering rather than a flannel vest . He was such a rake as a young man ! Those sort of people , madame , have not the least regularity ; he ’ s burnt up with brandy . Still it ’ s sad , all the same , to see an acquaintance go off. ” And while he fastened up his box he discoursed about the doctor ’ s patients . “ It ’ s the weather , no doubt , ” he said , looking frowningly at the floor , “ that	1850
crossed her bare arms , hiding her face in her hands . The warm room , with its discreet carpet , its gay ornaments , and its calm light , seemed made for the intimacies of passion . The curtain-rods , ending in arrows , their brass pegs , and the great balls of the fire-dogs shone suddenly when the sun came in . On the chimney between the candelabra there were two of those pink shells in which one hears the murmur of the sea if one holds them to the ear . How they loved that dear room , so full of gaiety , despite its rather faded splendour ! They always found the furniture in the same place , and sometimes hairpins	1850
with his left leg . When he had taken in his other hand the cure ’ s umbrella , they started . The town was asleep ; the pillars of the market threw great shadows ; the earth was all grey as on a summer ’ s night . But as the doctor ’ s house was only some fifty paces from the inn , they had to say good-night almost immediately , and the company dispersed . As soon as she entered the passage , Emma felt the cold of the plaster fall about her shoulders like damp linen . The walls were new and the wooden stairs creaked . In their bedroom , on the first floor	1850
killed at every stage , horses ridden to death on every page , sombre forests , heartaches , vows , sobs , tears and kisses , little skiffs by moonlight , nightingales in shady groves , “ gentlemen ” brave as lions , gentle as lambs , virtuous as no one ever was , always well dressed , and weeping like fountains . For six months , then , Emma , at fifteen years of age , made her hands dirty with books from old lending libraries . Through Walter Scott , later on , she fell in love with historical events , dreamed of old chests , guard-rooms and minstrels . She would have liked to live in some old manor-house , like those long-waisted chatelaines who , in the shade of pointed arches , spent their days leaning on the stone , chin in hand , watching	1850
horses perhaps are mettlesome. ” She heard a noise above her ; it was Félicité drumming on the windowpanes to amuse little Berthe . The child blew her a kiss ; her mother answered with a wave of her whip . “ A pleasant ride ! ” cried Monsieur Homais . “ Prudence ! above all , prudence ! ” And he flourished his newspaper as he saw them disappear . As soon as he felt the ground , Emma ’ s horse set off at a gallop . Rodolphe galloped by her side . Now and then they exchanged a word . Her figure slightly bent , her hand	1850
her heart without getting a spark , incapable , moreover , of understanding what she did not experience as of believing anything that did not present itself in conventional forms , she persuaded herself without difficulty that Charles ’ s passion was nothing very exorbitant . His outbursts became regular ; he embraced her at certain fixed times . It was one habit among other habits , and , like a dessert , looked forward to after the monotony of dinner . A gamekeeper , cured by the doctor of inflammation of the lungs , had given madame a little Italian greyhound	1850
a last vestige of Gothic food that goes back , perhaps , to the time of the Crusades , and with which the robust Normans gorged themselves of yore , fancying they saw on the table , in the light of the yellow torches , between tankards of hippocras and huge boars ’ heads , the heads of Saracens to be devoured . The druggist ’ s wife crunched them up as they had done -- heroically , despite her wretched teeth . And so whenever Homais journeyed to town , he never failed to bring her home some that he bought at the great baker ’ s in the Rue Massacre . “	1850
then beginning it again , so that he rang the Angelus to suit his own convenience . Besides , the ringing over a little earlier warned the lads of catechism hour . Already a few who had arrived were playing marbles on the stones of the cemetery . Others , astride the wall , swung their legs , kicking with their clogs the large nettles growing between the little enclosure and the newest graves . This was the only green spot . All the rest was but stones , always covered with a fine powder , despite the vestry-broom . The children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an enclosure made for them . The shouts of their voices could	1850
reins . Those who stayed at the Bertaux spent the night drinking in the kitchen . The children had fallen asleep under the seats . The bride had begged her father to be spared the usual marriage pleasantries . However , a fishmonger , one of their cousins ( who had even brought a pair of soles for his wedding present ) , began to squirt water from his mouth through the keyhole , when old Rouault came up just in time to stop him , and explain to him that the distinguished position of his son-in-law would not allow of such liberties . The cousin all the same did not give in to these reasons readily . In his heart he accused old Rouault of being proud , and he joined four or five other guests in a corner , who having	1850
manner of a tassel . The cap was new ; its peak shone . “ Rise , ” said the master . He stood up ; his cap fell . The whole class began to laugh . He stooped to pick it up . A neighbor knocked it down again with his elbow ; he picked it up once more . “ Get rid of your helmet , ” said the master , who was a bit of a wag . There was a burst of laughter from the boys , which so thoroughly put the poor lad out of countenance that he did not	1850
said I , `` pray , Mr. Branghton , have the goodness to give up this plan ; I know but very little of his Lordship , and can not , upon any account , take so great a liberty . '' `` Do n't say nothing about it , '' said Madam Duval , `` for I shall have it my own way : so , if you wo n't call the coachman , Sir , I 'll promise you I 'll call him myself . '' The footman , very impertinently , laughed and turned upon his heel . Madame Duval , extremely irritated , ran out in the rain , and beckoned the coachman , who instantly obeyed her summons	1770
; but made me follow him to an apartment , where we found an excellent fire , and some company waiting for carriages . I readily accepted a seat , and then begged he would go . And go , indeed , he did ; but he returned in a moment , telling me that the rain was more violent than ever , and that he had sent his servants to offer their assistance , and acquaint the Mirvans of my situation . I was very mad that he would not go himself ; but as my acquaintance with him was so very slight , I did not think proper to urge him contrary to his inclination .	1770
answer , he led me to the garden ; at the door of which , however , I absolutely insisted upon stopping . He seemed very serious , and said , in a grave tone of voice , `` At length , Miss Anville , I flatter myself I have hit upon an expedient that will oblige you ; and therefore , though it is death to myself , I will put in practice . '' I begged him to explain himself . `` I saw your desire of saving Madame Duval , and scarce could I refrain giving the brutal Captain my real opinion of his savage conduct ; but I am unwilling to quarrel with him , lest I should be denied entrance into a house which you inhabit ; I have been endeavouring to	1770
desirous of making some apology to Lord Orville , for the impertinence of which he must have thought me guilty at the ridotto , and yet so utterly unable to assume sufficient courage to speak to him , concerning an affair in which I had so terribly exposed myself , that I hardly ventured to say a word all the time we were walking . Besides , the knowledge of his contemptuous opinion haunted and dispirited me , and made me fear he might possibly misconstrue whatever I should say . So that , far from enjoying a conversation which might , at any other time , have delighted me , I continued silent , uncomfortable , and ashamed . O , Sir , shall I ever again involve myself in so foolish an embarrassment ? I am sure that , if I do	1770
should choose to introduce him where he is so unwelcome : and , indeed , it is strange that they should be so constantly together , though I believe I should have taken notice of it , but that Captain Mirvan is perpetually rallying me upon my grandmama 's beau . They were both received by Mrs. Mirvan with her usual good-breeding ; but the Captain , most provokingly , attacked her immediately , saying , `` Now , Madame , you that have lived abroad , please to tell me this here : Which did you like best , the warm room at Ranelagh , or the	1770
of laughter , and for some minutes we were kept prisoners , till at last one of them , rudely seizing hold of me , said I was a pretty little creature . Terrified to death , I struggled with such vehemence to disengage myself from him , that I succeeded , in spite of his efforts to detain me ; and immediately , and with a swiftness which fear only could have given me , I flew rather than ran up the walk , hoping to secure my safety by returning to the lights and company we had so foolishly left :	1770
much sooner regretted than repaired . Your health , you tell me , is much mended : -Can you then consent to leave Bristol ? -not abruptly , that I do not desire , but in a few days from the time you receive this ? I will write to Mrs. Selwyn , and tell her how much I wish your return ; and Mrs. Clinton can take sufficient care of you . I have meditated upon every possible expedient that might tend to your happiness , ere I fixed upon exacting from you a compliance which I am convinced will be most painful to you ; but I can satisfy myself in none . This will at least be safe ; and as to success , -we must leave it to time . I am very glad to hear of Mr. Macartney 's welfare .	1770
of these memoirs , young , artless , and inexperienced , is No faultless Monster that the world ne'er saw ; but the offspring of Nature , and of Nature in her simplest attire . In all the Arts , the value of copies can only be proportioned to the scarcity of originals : among sculptors and painters , a fine statue , or a beautiful picture , of some great master , may deservedly employ the imitative talents of young and inferior artists , that their appropriation to one spot may not wholly prevent the more general expansion of their excellence ; but , among authors , the reverse	1770

'' `` Let him , if he dares ! '' cried Madame Duval ; `` but	1770
Madame Duval had ordered we should be denied to him , I was obliged to return up stairs ; and after he was gone , my application was too late , as the maid had given it to a porter . My time did not pass very serenely while he was gone ; however , he brought me no answer , but that Lord Orville was not at home . Whether or not he will take the trouble to send any , -or whether he will condescend to call , -or whether the affair will rest as it is , I know not ; -but , in being ignorant , am most cruelly anxious . LETTER LV . EVELINA IN CONTINUATION . July 4th . YOU may now , my dear Sir , send Mrs. Clinton for your Evelina with as much	1770
meant ; such rudeness , from a man of any family , is quite incomprehensible . '' `` My Lord , '' cried Lady Louisa to Lord Merton , `` do you know he did the same by me ? -I was just going to ask him what was the matter ; but he ran past me so quick , that I declare he quite dazzled my eyes . You ca n't think , my Lord , how he frightened me ; I dare say I look as pale-do n't I look very pale , my Lord ? '' `` Your Ladyship , '' said Mr. Lovel , `` so well becomes the lilies , that	1770
's daughter . Besides , between friends , I , who know the world , can see that half this prodigious delicacy for the little usurper is the mere result of self-interest ; for , while her affairs are hushed up , Sir John 's , you know , are kept from being brought further to light . Now the double marriage we have projected obviates all rational objections . Sir John will give you immediately L.30,000 ; all settlements , and so forth , will be made for you in the name of Evelina Belmont : -Mr. Macartney will at the same time take poor Polly Green ; and yet , at first , it will only be generally known that a daughter of Sir John Belmont is married .

With what politeness did he address me ! with what sweetness did he look at me ! the very tone of his voice seemed flattering ! he congratulated himself upon his good fortune in meeting with me	1770

GENTLEMEN , The liberty which I take in addressing to you the trifling production of a few idle hours , will doubtless move your wonder , and probably your contempt . I will not , however , with the futility of apologies , intrude upon your time , but briefly acknowledge the motives of my temerity	1770
power ? -But tell me , where is our father at present ? '' `` At the Hot-Wells , Madam ; he arrived there yesterday morning . '' I would have proceeded with further questions , but the entrance of Lord Orville prevented me . The moment he saw us , he started , and would have retreated ; but , drawing my hand from Mr. Macartney 's , I begged him to come in . For a few moments we were all silent , and , I believe , all in equal confusion . Mr. Macartney , however , recollecting himself said `` I	1770
, 't is the same person I took for your relation ! '' And then , to the utter astonishment of every body but himself , he hauled into the room a monkey , full-dressed , and extravagantly -e ; la mode ! The dismay of the company was almost general . Poor Mr. Lovel seemed thunderstruck with indignation and surprise : Lady Louisa began a scream , which for some time was incessant ; Miss Mirvan and I jumped involuntarily upon the seats of our chairs ; Mrs. Beaumont herself followed our example ; Lord Orville placed himself before me as a guard ; and Mrs. Selwyn , Lord Merton , and Mr. Coverley , burst into a loud , immoderate , ungovernable fit of laughter , in which they were joined by the Captain , till , unable to support himself	1770
dear Sir , we all hope every thing from your goodness . M. HOWARD . LETTER VIII EVELINA TO THE REV . MR. VILLARS Howard Grove , March 26 . THIS house seems to be the house of joy ; every face wears a smile , and a laugh is at every body 's service . It is quite amusing to walk about and see the general confusion ; a room leading to the garden is fitting up for Captain Mirvan 's study . Lady Howard does not sit a moment in a place ; Miss Mirvan is making caps ; every body so busy ! -such flying from room to room ! -so	1770
his sister . How can that young lady see her brother so universally admired for his manners and deportment , and yet be so unamiably opposite to him in hers ! but while his mind , enlarged and noble , rises superior to the little prejudices of rank , hers , feeble and unsteady , sinks beneath their influence . Lord Orville , I am sure , was hurt and displeased : he bit his lips , and , turning from her , addressed himself wholly to me , till we were summoned to dinner . Do you think I was not grateful for his attention ? yes , indeed , and every angry idea I had entertained was totally obliterated . As we were seating ourselves at the table , Mr. Coverley	1770
to be a little greased : however , we shall have it to drink tea in , and then , perhaps , you may see him ; and I assure you he 's quite like one of the quality , and dresses as fine , and goes to balls and dances , and every thing , quite in taste ; and besides , Miss , he keeps a foot-boy of his own too . '' The dinner was ill-served , ill-cooked , and ill-managed . The maid who waited had so often to go down stairs for something that was forgotten , that the Branghtons were perpetually obliged to rise from table themselves , to get plates , knives , and forks , bread or beer . Had they been without pretensions , all this would have seemed of no consequence ; but they aimed at	1770
would let such a-such a person as that keep company with you . '' `` I am very sorry , Madam , '' said Sir Clement , in a tone of surprise , `` if I had been so unfortunate as to offend you ; but I believe you will not regret the honour I now have of attending Miss Anville , when you hear that I have been so happy as to do her some service . '' Just as Madame Duval , with her usual Ma foi , was beginning to reply , the attention of Sir Clement was wholly drawn from her , by the appearance of Mr. Smith , who ,	1770
abated ; the road before me seemed less thorny and intricate , and I thought I could perceive the right path from the wrong : for when I observed the artless openness the ingenuous simplicity of her nature ; when I saw that her guileless and innocent soul fancied all the world to be pure and disinterested as herself , and that her heart was open to every impression with which love , pity , or art might assail it ; -then did I flatter myself , that to follow my own inclination , and to secure her welfare , was the same	1770
offered her my own seat . Leaving the rest of the company to entertain themselves , he very abruptly began to address himself to me , in a style of gallantry equally new and disagreeable to me . It is true , no man can possibly pay me greater compliments , or make more fine speeches , than Sir Clement Willoughby : yet his language , though too flowery , is always that of a gentleman ; and his address and manners are so very superior to those of the inhabitants of this house , that , to make any comparison between him and Mr. Smith , would be extremely unjust . This latter seems very desirous of appearing a man of gaiety and spirit ; but his vivacity is	1770
usual politeness , something civil to each of us , with a very grave air he quitted us . Lord - remained some minutes longer , which he spent in making a profusion of compliments to me ; by which he prevented my hearing distinctly what Lord Orville said , to my great vexation , especially as he looked-I thought so , at least-as if displeased at his particularity of behaviour to me . In going to an outward room , to wait for the carriage , I walked , and could not possibly avoid it , between this nobleman and Sir Clement Willoughby , and , when the servant	1770
what was the mortification I suffered in answering , `` My Lord , I am-in Holborn ! '' He then bowed and left us . What , what can he think of this adventure ! how strangely how cruelly have all appearances turned against me ! Had I been blessed with any presence of mind , I should instantly have explained to him the accident which occasioned my being in such terrible company : -but I have none ! As to the rest of the evening , I can not relate the particulars of what passed ; for , to you , I only write of what I think ; and I can think of nothing but this unfortunate , this disgraceful meeting . These two wretched women continued to torment us all , but especially poor Mr. Brown , who seemed to afford them uncommon	1770
warmly against this plan , telling them it would endanger our missing the rest of the party all the evening . `` O dear , '' cried Miss Branghton , `` I thought how uneasy Miss would be without a beau ! '' This impertinence I did not think worth answering ; and , quite by compulsion , I followed them down a long alley , in which there was hardly any light . By the time we came near the end , a large party of gentlemen , apparently very riotous , and who were hallooing , leaning on one another , and laughing immoderately , seemed to rush suddenly from behind some trees , and meeting us face to face , put their arms at their sides , and formed a kind of circle , which first stopped our proceeding , and then our retreating	1770
three in my life ! But I never had the least turn for dress , -never any notion of fancy or elegance . '' `` O fie , Mr. Lovel ! how can you talk so ? -do n't we all know that you lead the ton in the beau monde ? I declare , I think you dress better than any body . '' `` O , dear Ma'am , you confuse me to the last degree ! I dress well ! -I protest I do n't think I 'm ever fit to be seen ! I 'm often shocked to death to think what a figure	1770
, but too much talking to hear it well . Indeed I am quite astonished to find how little music is attended to in silence ; for , though every body seems to admire , hardly any body listens . We did not see Lord Orville till we went into the tea-room , which is large , low , and under ground , and serves merely as a foil to the apartments above ; he then sat next to us . He seemed to belong to a large party , chiefly of ladies ; but , among the gentlemen attending them , I	1770
joy now vanished , and gave place to shame and confusion ; for I could not endure that he should know how long a time Sir Clement and I had been together , since I was not at liberty to assign any reason for it . They all expressed great satisfaction at seeing me ; and said they had been extremely uneasy and surprised that I was so long coming home , as they had heard from Lord Orville that I was not with Madame Duval . Sir Clement , in an affected passion , said , that his booby of a servant had misunderstood his orders , and was driving us to the upper end of Piccadilly . For my part , I only coloured ; for though I would not forfeit my	1770
said Miss Polly , `` when you come next , Miss , we 'll have Mr. Smith 's room : and it 's a very pretty one , and only up one pair of stairs , and nicely furnished , and every thing . '' `` To say the truth , '' said Miss Branghton , `` I thought that my cousin would not , upon any account , have come to town in the summer-time ; for it 's not at all the fashion ; -so , to be sure , thinks I , she 'll stay till September , when the play-houses	1770
therefore , only saying I must hasten to dress , I ran up stairs , rather abruptly I own ; and so , I fear , Lord Orville must think . Yet what could I do ? Unused to the situations in which I find myself , and embarrassed by the slightest difficulties , I seldom , till too late , discover how I ought to act . Just as we were all assembled to dinner , Mrs. Selwyn 's man , coming into the parlour , presented to me a letter , and said , `` I ca n't find out Mr. Macartney , Madam ; but the post-office people will let you know	1770
year old . 'Unwilling , ' he added , 'at that time to confirm the rumour of my being married , I sent the woman with the child to France : as soon as she was old enough , I put her into a convent , where she has been properly educated , and now I have taken her home . I have acknowledged her for my lawful child , and paid , at length , to the memory of her unhappy mother a tribute of fame , which has made me wish to hide myself hereafter from all the world . ' This whole story sounded so improbable , that I did not scruple to tell him I discredited every word . He then rung his bell	1770
Madam , so hard is it to root from the mind its favourite principles or prejudices , call them which you please , that I lingered another week ere I had the resolution to send away a letter , which I regarded as the death of my independence . At length , reduced to my last shilling , shunned insolently by the people of the house , and almost famished , I sealed this fatal letter ; and , with a heavy heart , determined to take it to the post office . But Mr. Branghton and his son suffered me not to	1770
but pitied my embarrassment ; for he said in a tone of voice unusually softened , `` To offer my services in the presence of Sir Clement Willoughby would be superfluous ; but I hope I need not assure Miss Anville how happy it would make me to be of the least use to her . '' I courtsied my thanks . Sir Clement , with great earnestness , pressed me to go ; and while I was thus uneasily deliberating what to do , the dance , I suppose , finished , for the people crowded down stairs . Had Lord Orville then repeated his offer , I would have accepted it	1770
arrived at our journey 's end ; and then a new distress occurred : Madame Duval was eager to speak to Lady Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan , and to relate her misfortunes : but she could not endure that Sir Clement or the Captain should see her in such disorder ; so she said they were so ill-natured , that instead of pitying her , they would only make a jest of her disasters . She therefore sent me first into the house , to wait for an opportunity of their being out of the way , that she might steal up stairs unobserved . In this I succeeded , as the gentlemen thought it most prudent not to seem watching for	1770
chagrined , as I knew he was engaged at the Hotwells in the afternoon . Seeing , therefore , no probability of speaking to him before the time of my meeting Mr. Macartney arrived , I determined that , rather than risk his ill opinion , I would leave Mr. Macartney to his own suggestions . Yet , when I reflected upon his peculiar situation , his poverty , his sadness , and , more than all the rest , the idea I knew he entertained of what he calls his obligations to me , I could not resolve upon a breach of promise , which might be attributed to causes , of all the others the most offensive to one whom misfortune has made extremely suspicious of slights and contempt . After the most uneasy consideration , I at length determined	1770
cause of what followed ; for he came to me , and took my hand saying , `` I do think , that whoever has once seen Miss Anville , must receive an impression never to be forgotten . '' This compliment , -from Lord Orville , -so surprised me , that I could not speak ; but felt myself change colour , and stood for some moments silent , and looking down : however , the instant I recollected my situation , I withdrew my hand , and told him that I would see if Mrs. Mirvan was not dressed . He did	1770
he passionately kissed my hand . Never , in my whole life , have I been so terrified . I broke forcibly from him , and , putting my head out of the window , called aloud to the man to stop . Where we then were , I know not ; but I saw not a human being , or I should have called for help . Sir Clement , with great earnestness , endeavoured to appease and compose me : `` If you do not intend to murder me , '' cried I , `` for mercy 's , for pity 's sake , let me	1770
transport should I , through thy means , devote it to the relief of indigent virtue ! yet let us not repine at the limitation of our power ; for while our bounty is proportioned to our ability , the difference of the greater or less donation can weigh but little in the scale of justice . In reading your account of the misguided man , whose misery has so largely excited your compassion , I am led to apprehend that his unhappy situation is less the effect of misfortune than of misconduct . If he is reduced to that state of poverty represented by the Branghtons , he	1770
take leave of him , -I will run away without seeing him : -implicitly will I follow your advice , avoid his sight , and shun his society ! To-morrow morning I will set off for Berry Hill . Mrs. Selwyn and Mrs. Beaumont shall alone know my intention . And to-day-I will spend in my own room . The readiness of my obedience is the only atonement I can offer for the weakness which calls for its exertion . Can you , will you , most honoured , most dear Sir ! sole prop by which the poor Evelina	1770
if I own I obeyed without reluctance : after so long a separation , should I not else have been the most ungrateful of mortals ? -And yet , -oh , Maria ! though I wished to leave London , the gratification of my wish afforded me no happiness ! and though I felt an impatience inexpressible to return hither , no words , no language , can explain the heaviness of heart with which I made the journey . I believe you would hardly have known me ; -indeed , I hardly know myself . Perhaps , had I first seen you , in your kind and sympathizing	1770
lady see her brother so universally admired for his manners and deportment , and yet be so unamiably opposite to him in hers ! but while his mind , enlarged and noble , rises superior to the little prejudices of rank , hers , feeble and unsteady , sinks beneath their influence . Lord Orville , I am sure , was hurt and displeased : he bit his lips , and , turning from her , addressed himself wholly to me , till we were summoned to dinner . Do you think I was not grateful for his attention ? yes , indeed , and every angry idea I had entertained was totally obliterated . As we were seating ourselves at the table ,	1770
been present , I should have thought it impossible for a woman , at her time of life , to be so very difficult in regard to dress . What she may have in view , I can not imagine , but the labour of the toilette seems the chief business of her life . When I left her , in my way down stairs , I met Sir Clement ; who with great earnestness , said he must not be denied the honour of a moment 's conversation with me ; and then , without waiting for an answer , he led me to the garden ; at the door of which , however , I absolutely insisted upon stopping . He seemed very serious , and said	1770
, whom , to nobody belonging , by nobody was noticed . Ill brooking such a situation , and unable to suport the neglect of Lord Orville , the moment breakfast was over I left the room , and was going up stairs ; when , very unpleasantly , I was stopped by Sir Clement Willoughby , who , flying into the hall , prevented my proceeding . He enquired very particularly after my health , and entreated me to return into the parlour . Unwillingly , I consented , but thought any thing preferable to continuing alone with him ; and he would neither leave me ,	1770
further particulars concerning him . They then acquainted me , that they had only known him three months . When he first lodged with them , he agreed to board also ; but had lately told them he would eat by himself , though they all believed he had hardly ever tasted a morsel of meat since he left their table . They said , that he had always appeared very low-spirited ; but for the last month he had been duller than ever ; and , all of a sudden , he had put himself into mourning , though they knew not for whom , nor for what ; but they supposed it was only for convenience , as no person had ever	1770
effect ? '' `` Cause , Sir ! '' cried I , greatly alarmed , `` what cause ? -I do n't know , -I ca n't tell-I- '' `` Fear not , '' said he , kindly , `` to unbosom thyself to me , my dearest Evelina ; open to me thy whole heart , -it can have no feelings for which I will not make allowance . Tell me , therefore , what it is that thus afflicts us both ; and who knows but I may suggest some means of relief ? '' `` You are too , too good , '' cried I , greatly embarrassed ; `` but indeed I know not what you mean . '' `` I see , '' said he , `` it is painful to you to	1770
, knew Lord Orville , because I am sure you would love him ; and I have felt that wish for no other person I have seen since I came to London . I sometimes imagine , that when his youth is flown , his vivacity abated , and his life is devoted to retirement , he will , perhaps , resemble him whom I most love and honour . His present sweetness , politeness , and diffidence , seem to promise in future the same benevolence , dignity , and goodness . But I must not expatiate upon this subject	1770
and looking down : however , the instant I recollected my situation , I withdrew my hand , and told him that I would see if Mrs. Mirvan was not dressed . He did not oppose me-so away I went . I met them all on the stairs , and returned with them to breakfast . I have since been extremely angry with myself for neglecting so excellent an opportunity of apologizing for my behaviour at the ridotto : but , to own the truth , that affair never once occurred to me during the short tete-e-tete which we had together . But , if ever we should happen to be so situated again , I will certainly mention it ; for I am inexpressibly concerned at the thought of his harbouring an opinion that I	1770
he , `` I wished to see together . Will you , Madam ( taking my hand ) , allow me the honour of introducing you , by your real name , to two of my nearest relations ? Mrs. Beaumont , give me leave to present to you the daughter of Sir John Belmont , a young lady who , I am sure , must long since have engaged your esteem and admiration , though you were a stranger to her birth . '' `` My Lord , '' said Mrs. Beaumont , graciously saluting me , `` the young lady 's rank in	1770
; but I hope I need not assure Miss Anville how happy it would make me to be of the least use to her . '' I courtsied my thanks . Sir Clement , with great earnestness , pressed me to go ; and while I was thus uneasily deliberating what to do , the dance , I suppose , finished , for the people crowded down stairs . Had Lord Orville then repeated his offer , I would have accepted it notwithstanding Sir Clement 's repugnance ; but I fancy he thought it would be impertinent . In a very few minutes I heard Madame Duval 's voice , as she descended from the gallery . ``	1770
I 'll tell my brother of that ! '' Miss Mirvan , who had never before seen them , and could not at first imagine who they were , looked so much astonished , that I was ready to laugh myself , till the eldest said , `` We 're come to take you to the opera , Miss ; papa and my brother are below , and we are to call for your grand-mama as we go along . '' `` I am very sorry , '' answered I , `` that you should have taken so much trouble , as I am engaged already . '' `` Engaged ! Lord , Miss , never mind that , '' cried	1770
-I , alas , upon your experience ; and , whenever I doubted the weakness of my heart , the idea that you did not suspect it , reassured me , -restored my courage , and confirmed my error ! -Yet am I most sensible of the kindness of your silence . Oh , Sir ! why have I ever quitted you ? why been exposed to dangers to which I am so unequal ? But I will leave this place , leave Lord Orville , -leave him , perhaps , for ever ! -no matter ; your counsel , your goodness , may teach me how to recover the peace and the serenity of	1770
`` Why , then , pray , Sir , '' returned she , `` tell me the reaon why you took the liberty to treat the gentleman in such an unpolite way , as to take and pull him neck and heels out ? I 'm sure he had n't done nothing to affront you , nor nobody else ; and I do n't know what great hurt he would have done you , by just sitting still in the coach ; he would not have eat it . '' `` What , do you think , then , that my horses have nothing to do but to carry about your snivelling Frenchmen ? If you do , Madam , I must make bold to tell you , you are out , for I 'll see 'em hang 'd first . '' `` More brute you , then	1770
not form a wish against propriety : I will ask no questions , I will rely upon her own purity , and , uninformed , blindfold as I am , I will serve her with all my power ! '' And then he went into the shop , leaving me so strangely affected by his generous behaviour , that I almost wished to follow him with my thanks . When Mrs. Selwyn had transacted her affairs , we returned home . The moment dinner was over , Lord Orville went out , and did not come back till just as we were summoned to supper . This is the longest time he has spent from	1770
of the company to which I belonged , attracted general notice and observation . In a short time , however , we arrived at one of the door-keeper 's bars . Mr. Branghton demanded for what part of the house they took money ? They answered , the pit ; and regarded us all with great earnestness . The son then advancing , said `` Sir , if you please , I beg that I may treat Miss . '' `` We 'll settle that another time , '' answered Mr. Branghton , and put down a guinea . Two tickets of admission were given to him . Mr. Branghton	1770
one listens ; -for , indeed , by the time it is evening , one has been so fatigued with dining , -or wine , -or the house , -or studying , -that it is-it is perfectly an impossibility . But , now I think of it , I believe I have a bill in my pocket ; O , ay , here it is-Love for Love , ay , -true , ha , ha ! -how could I be so stupid ! '' `` O , easily enough , as to that , I warrant you , '' said the Captain	1770
my adored Miss Anville , to take the only opportunity that is allowed me , to speak upon another , a much dearer , much sweeter subject . '' And then he hastily came into the chariot , and seated himself next to me . I would fain have disengaged myself from him , but he would not let me : `` Deny me not , most charming of women , '' cried he , `` deny me not this only moment that is lent me , to pour forth my soul into your gentle ears , -to tell you how much I suffer from your absence , -how much I dread your displeasure , -and how cruelly I am affected by your coldness ! '' ``	1770
who received it with an air of exultation ; and very frequently they each of them , though from different motives , looked back , to discover whether I observed their good intelligence . Madame Duval walked with M. Du Bois , and Mr. Branghton by himself ; but his son would willingly have attached himself wholly to me ; saying frequently , `` come , Miss , let 's you and I have a little fun together : you see they have all left us , so now let 's leave them . '' But I begged to be excused , and went to the other side of Madame Duval . This Garden , as it is called , is neither striking for	1770
into the ditch ! I 'm sure , I thought he 'd have murdered me , as much as ever I thought any thing in my life ; for he kept bumping me about , as if he thought nothing too bad for me . However , I 'm resolved I 'll never leave my purse behind me again , the longest day I have to live . So when he could n't stand over me no longer , he holds out his hands again for my money ; but he was as cunning as could be , for he would n't speak a word , because I should n't swear to his voice ; however	1770
place at present she can be in . The joyful occasion of the journey ; the gaiety of the whole party , opposed to the dull life she must lead , if left here with a solitary old woman for her sole companion , while she so well knows the cheerfulness and felicity enjoyed by the rest of the family , -are circumstances that seem to merit your consideration . Mrs. Mirvan desires me to assure you that one week is all she asks , as she is certain that the Captain , who hates London , will be eager to revisit Howard Grove ; and Maria is so very earnest in wishing to have the company of her friend , that , if you are inexorable ,	1770
possible , that , so unmoved , that , with such petrifying indifference , you can tear from me even the remotest hope ! '' `` I know not , Sir , '' said I , endeavouring to disengage myself from him , `` what hope you mean , but I am sure that I never intended to give you any . '' `` You distract me , '' cried he , `` I can not endure such scorn ; -I beseech you to have some moderation in your cruelty , lest you make me desperate : -say , then , that you pity me , -O fairest inexorable ! loveliest tyrant ! -say , tell me , at least , that you pity me ! '' Just then , who should come in sight , as if	1770
the shop , leaving me so strangely affected by his generous behaviour , that I almost wished to follow him with my thanks . When Mrs. Selwyn had transacted her affairs , we returned home . The moment dinner was over , Lord Orville went out , and did not come back till just as we were summoned to supper . This is the longest time he has spent from the house since I have been at Clifton ; and you can not imagine , my dear Sir , how much I missed him . I scarce knew before how	1770
, when too late , you may regret that you have destroyed ; -you may think with horror of the deceptions you have practised , and the pangs of remorse may follow me to the tomb : -Oh , Belmont , all my resentment softens into pity at the thought ! what will become of thee , good Heaven , when , with the eye of penitence , thou reviewest thy past conduct ! Hear , then , the solemn , the last address , with which the unhappy Caoline will importune thee . If when the time of thy contrition arrives , -for arrive it must ! -when the sense of thy treachery shall rob thee	1770
( kissing my hand , and joining it with her Ladyship 's ) to have the happiness of presenting to you by yet another name , and by the most endearing of all titles . '' I believe it would be difficult to say whose cheeks were , at that moment , of the deepest dye , Lady Louisa 's or my own ; for the conscious pride with which she has hitherto slighted me , gave to her an embarrassment which equalled the confusion that an introduction so unexpected gave to me . She saluted me , however ; and , with a faint smile said , `` I shall esteem myself very happy to profit by the honour of Miss Belmont 's acquaintance . '' I only courtsied , and we walked on ; but it was evident , from the little surprise they expressed , that	1770
ere she could give , or I could hear , the account of her visit ; and then she related it in a hasty manner ; yet , I believe I can recollect every word . `` I found Sir John alone . He received me with the utmost politeness . I did not keep him a moment in suspense as to the purport of my visit . But I had no sooner made it known , than , with a supercilious smile , he said , 'And have you , Madam , been prevailed upon to revive that ridiculous old story ? ' Ridiculous , I told him	1770
have never , Sir , professed any . '' Here they were both , for a few moments , silent ; and then Sir Clement said , `` To what , my Lord , must I then impute your desire of knowing mine ? '' `` To an unaffected interest in Miss Anville 's welfare . '' `` Such an interest , '' said Sir Clement , drily , `` is indeed very generous ; but , except in a father , -a brother , -or a lover- '' `` Sir Clement , '' interrupted his Lordship , `` I know	1770
conduct is the same for both sexes , though the manner in which it is pursued may somewhat vary , and be accommodated to the strength or weakness of the different travellers . There is , however , something so mysterious in all you have seen or heard of this wretched man , that I am unwilling to stamp a bad impression of his character upon so slight and partial a knowledge of it . Where any thing is doubtful , the ties of society , and the laws of humanity , claim a favourable interpretation ; but remember , my dear child , that those of discretion have an equal claim to your regard . As to	1770
Mrs. Beaumont , `` and I believe he wished to see you . '' `` My Lord drove so monstrous fast , '' said Lady Louisa , `` that perhaps we passed him . He frightened me out of my senses ; I declare my head is quite giddy . Do you know , Ma'am , we have done nothing but quarrel all the morning ? -You ca n't think how I 've scolded ; have not I , my Lord ? '' and she smiled expressively at Lord Merton . `` You have been , as you always are , '' said he , twisting his whip with his fingers , `` all sweetness . '' `` O	1770
'pon honour , I believe he came here for no purpose in the world but to pick a quarrel ; however , for my part , I vow I wo'n't humour him . '' `` I declare , '' cried Lady Louisa , `` he put me in a monstrous fright ; -I never heard any body talk so shocking in my life ! '' `` I think , '' said Mrs. Selwyn , with great solemnity , `` he threatened to box your ears , Mr. Lovel ; -did not he ? '' `` Really , Ma'am , '' said Mr. Lovel , colouring , `` if one was to mind every thing those low kind of people say , one should never be at rest for one impertinence or other ; so I	1770
and forces mine ; it is so pointed , that it always confuses me , and so public , that it attracts general notice . Indeed I have sometimes thought that he would rather wish , than dislike to have his partiality for me known , as he takes great care to prevent my being spoken to by any but himself . When at length he went away , Lord Orville took his seat , and said , with a half smile , `` Shall I call Sir Clement , -or will you call me an usurper for taking this place ? -You make me no answer ? -Must I then suppose that Sir Clement- '' `` It is little worth your Lordship 's while , '' said I ,	1770
her ; but Lord Merton , to whom she did not belong , stopped me , calling out , `` No foul play ! No foul play ! '' Mr. Coverley then , repeating the same words , went himself to help her , and insisted that the other should stop . A debate ensued ; but the poor creature was too much hurt to move , and declared her utter inability to make another attempt . Mr. Coverley was quite brutal : he swore at her with unmanly rage , and seemed scarce able to refrain even from striking her . Lord Merton then , in great rapture	1770
of utterance . He then read aloud from the letter , `` Look not like thy unfortunate mother ! '' `` Sweet soul , with what bitterness of spirit hast thou written ! -Come hither , Evelina : Gracious Heaven ! ( looking earnestly at me ) never was likeness more striking ! -the eyes-the face-the form-Oh , my child , my child ! '' Imagine , Sir , -for I can never describe my feelings , when I saw him sink upon his knees before me ! `` Oh , dear resemblance of thy murdered mother ! -Oh , all that remains of the most injured of women ! behold thy father at thy feet ! -bending thus lowly to implore you would not hate him.-Oh , then , thou representative of my departed wife , speak to me	1770
, Sir Clement Willoughby , with even more than his usual politeness , told me he was come to spend the morning here ; -when , just now , I met him flying down stairs , as if pursued by the Furies ; and far from repeating his compliments , or making any excuse , he did not even answer a question I asked him , but rushed past me , with the rapidity of a thief from a bailiff ! '' `` I protest , '' said Mrs. Beaumont , `` I ca n't think what he meant ; such rudeness , from a man of any family , is quite incomprehensible . '' `` My Lord , '' cried Lady Louisa to Lord Merton , `` do you know he did the same by me ? -I was just going to ask him what was the matter ;	1770
him ; but Mrs. Selwyn , hastening after him , caught hold of his arm : `` Leave me , Madam , '' cried he , with quickness , `` and take care of the poor child : -bid her not think me unkind ; tell her , I would at this moment plunge a dagger in my heart to serve her : but she has set my brain on fire ; and I can see her no more ! '' Then , with a violence almost frantic , he ran up stairs . Oh , Sir , had I not indeed cause to dread this interview ? -an interview so unspeakably painful	1770
scorn ? '' `` You have tormented me to death ; you have forced me from my friends , and intruded yourself upon me , against my will , for a partner . '' `` Surely , my dear Madam , we ought to be better friends , since there seems to be something of sympathy in the frankness of our dispositions.-And yet , were you not an angel-how do you think I could brooke such contempt ? '' `` If I have offended you , '' cried I , `` you have but to leave me-and O how I wish you would ! '' `` My dear creature , '' said he , half laughing , `` why where could you be educated ? '' `` Where I most	1770
, and made a sudden effort to open the chariot-door myself , with a view of jumping into the street ; but he caught hold of me , exclaiming , `` For Heaven 's sake , what is the matter ? '' `` I-I do n't know , '' cried I ( quite out of breath ) , `` but I am sure the man goes wrong ; and if you will not speak to him , I am determined I will get out myself . '' `` You amaze me , '' answered he ( still holding me ) , `` I can not imagine what you apprehend . Surely you can have no doubts of my honour ? '' He drew me towards him as	1770
my own name . '' `` Here is certainly some mistake ; for I assure you , Ma'am- '' `` Do n't assure me nothing , '' cried Madame Duval , raising her voice ; `` I know what I 'm saying , and so do you too ; for did not you tell me all that about the Tower , and about M. Du Bois ? -why M. Du Bois was n't never there , nor nigh it , and so it was all your own invention . '' `` May there not be two persons of the same name ? the mistake was but natural- '' `` Do n't tell me of no mistake , for it was all on purpose : besides , did not you come , all in a mask , to the chariot-door , and help to get me put in that ditch	1770
`` I was this instant , Madam , '' said he , `` coming to see for you . '' `` You are mighty good , truly , '' cried she , `` to come when all the mischief 's over . '' She then entered , -in such a condition ! -entirely covered with mud , and in so great a rage , it was with difficulty she could speak . We all expressed our concern , and offered our assistance-except the Captain , who no sooner beheld her than he burst out into a loud laugh . We endeavoured , by	1770
uncomfortable imaginable . I found Madame Duval at breakfast in bed , though Monsieur Du Bois was in the chamber ; which so much astonished me , that I was , involuntarily , retiring , without considering how odd an appearance my retreat would have , when Madame Duval called me back , and laughed very heartily at my ignorance of foreign customs . The conversation , however , very soon took a more serious turn ; for she began , with great bitterness , to inveigh against the barbarous brutality of that fellow the Captain , and the horrible ill-breeding of the English in general , declaring , she should make her escape	1770
because he dresses so fine . '' `` It ought to be something that brings in a good income '' said Mr. Smith ; `` for I 'm sure that he did not get that suit of clothes he had on under thirty or forty pounds ; for I know the price of clothes pretty well.-Pray , Ma'am , can you tell me what he has a-year ? '' `` Do n't talk no more about him , '' cried Madame Duval , `` for I do n't like to hear his name : I believe he 's one of the worst persons in the world ; for though I never did him no manner of harm , nor so much as hurt a hair of his head , I know he was an accomplice with the fellow , Captain Mirvan , to take away my life	1770
to make any comparison between him and Mr. Smith , would be extremely unjust . This latter seems very desirous of appearing a man of gaiety and spirit ; but his vivacity is so low-bred , and his whole behaviour so forward and disagreeable , that I should prefer the company of dullness itself , even as that goddess is described by Pope , to that of this sprightly young man . He made many apologies that he had not lent his room for our dinner , which he said , he should certainly have done , had he seen me first : and he assured me , that when I came again , he should be very glad to oblige me . I told him , and with sincerity , that	1770
that moment , require all my resolution to guard me from frankly telling him whatever he wished to hear ? yet I rejoice that I did not ; for , added to the actual wrong I should have done , Lord Orville himself , when he had heard , would , I am sure , have blamed me . Fortunately , this thought occurred to me ; an I said , `` Your Lordship shall yourself be my judge ; the promise I made , though voluntary , was rash and inconsiderate ; yet , had it concerned myself , I would not have hesitated in fulfilling it ; but the gentleman , whose affairs I should be obliged to relate- '' `` Pardon me , '' cried he , `` for interrupting you ; yet allow	1770
; so , to my great relief , Lord Orville presently left us . I then told Mrs. Mirvan my disasters ; and she good-naturedly blamed herself for not having better instructed me ; but said , she had taken it for granted that I must know such common customs . However , the man may , I think , be satisfied with his pretty speech and carry his resentment no farther . In a short time Lord Orville returned . I consented , with the best grace I could , to go down another dance , for I had had time to recollect myself ; and therefore resolved	1770
his undeserved praises uttered by one so really good , so unsuspecting , so pure of heart . What he thought of my silence and uneasiness I fear to know ; but I hope he will mention the subject no more . I will not , however , with ungrateful indolence , give way to a sadness which I find infectious to him who merits the most cheerful exertion of my spirits . I am thankful that he has forborne to probe my wound ; and I will endeavour to heal it by the consciousness that I have not deserved the indignity	1770
. It is true , he could not have reinstated himself so highly in my opinion as I had once ignorantly placed him , since the conviction of such intemperance would have levelled him with the rest of his imperfect race ; yet my humbled pride might have been consoled by his acknowledgments . But why should I allow myself to be humbled by a man who can suffer his reason to be thus abjectly debased , when I am exalted by one who knows no vice , and scarcely a failing , but by hearsay ? To think of his kindness , and reflect upon his praises , might animate and comfort me even in the midst of affliction .	1770
Madame Duval . `` Why , you never knew such a fuss in your life as he made , because one day at dinner I only happened to say , that I supposed he had never got such a good meal in his life before he came to England : there , he fell in such a passion as you ca n't think : but for my part , I took no notice of it : for to be sure , thinks I , he must needs be a gentleman , or he 'd never go to be so angry about	1770
mischievous , I will not pretend to determine ; but certain it is , she attended to all I could say to her , though I have really fatigued myself with fruitless endeavours to entertain her , with the most immovable gravity ; but no sooner did Lovel begin his complaint , than she was seized with a fit of laughing , first affronting the poor beau , and then enjoying his mortification . '' `` Ha ! ha ! ha ! why there is some genius in that , my Lord , perhaps rather-rustic . '' Here Maria was called to dance , and so heard no more . Now , tell me , my dear Sir , did you ever know any	1770
to ask his consent- '' `` Not for the universe . '' `` Who is he , Madam ? '' I wished myself a hundred miles off . He repeated his question , `` What is his name ? '' `` Nothing-nobody-I do n't know- '' He assumed a most important solemnity : `` How ! -not know ? -Give me leave , my dear Madam , to recommend this caution to you : Never dance in public with a stranger , -with one whose name you are unacquainted with , -who may be a mere adventurer , -a man of no character , consider to what impertinence you may expose yourself . '' Was ever anything so ridiculous ? I	1770
IN CONTINUATION . Sept. 30th . OH , Sir , what a strange incident have I to recite ! what a field of conjecture to open ! Yesterday evening we all went to an assembly . Lord Orville presented tickets to the whole family ; and did me the honour , to the no small surprise of all here , I believe , to dance with me . But every day abounds in fresh instances of his condescending politeness ; and he now takes every opportunity of calling me his friend and his sister . Lord Merton offered a ticket to Lady Louisa ; but she was so much incensed against him , that she refused it with the utmost disdain : neither could he prevail upon her	1770
of your attachment , might possibly prevent that despondency with which young people , in similar circumstances , are apt to persuade themselves , that what is only difficult , is absolutely impossible . But , now , since you have again met , and have become more intimate than ever , all my hope from silence and seeming ignorance is at an end . Awake then , my dear , my deluded child , awake to the sense of your danger , and exert yourself to avoid the evils with which it threatens you : -evils which , to a mind like yours , are most to be dreaded ; secret repining ,	1770
would let such a-such a person as that keep company with you . '' `` I am very sorry , Madam , '' said Sir Clement , in a tone of surprise , `` if I had been so unfortunate as to offend you ; but I believe you will not regret the honour I now have of attending Miss Anville , when you hear that I have been so happy as to do her some service . '' Just as Madame Duval , with her usual Ma foi , was beginning to reply , the attention of Sir Clement was wholly drawn from her , by the appearance of Mr. Smith , who , coming suddenly behind me ,	1770
never had the least turn for dress , -never any notion of fancy or elegance . '' `` O fie , Mr. Lovel ! how can you talk so ? -do n't we all know that you lead the ton in the beau monde ? I declare , I think you dress better than any body . '' `` O , dear Ma'am , you confuse me to the last degree ! I dress well ! -I protest I do n't think I 'm ever fit to be seen ! I 'm often shocked to death to think what a figure I go . If your Ladyship will believe me , I was full half an hour this morning thinking what I should put on ! '' `` Odds my life , ''	1770
and embarrassment . When we walk out , he condescends to be my companion , and keeps by my side all the way we go . When we read , he marks the passages most worthy to be noticed , draws out my sentiments , and favours me with his own . At table , where he always sits next to me , he obliges me by a thousand nameless attentions ; while the distinguishing good-breeding with which he treats me , prevents my repining at the visibly-felt superiority of the rest of the company . A thousand occasional meetings could not have brought us to that degree of social freedom , which four days spent under the same roof have , insensibly , been productive of : and , as my only friend in this house , Mrs. Selwyn , is too much engrossed in perpetual conversation to	1770
'' cried he , `` is it possible you can be so cruel ? Can your nature and your countenance be so totally opposite ? Can the sweet bloom upon those charming cheeks , which appears as much the result of good-humour as of beauty- '' `` O , Sir , '' cried I , interrupting him , `` this is very fine ; but I had hoped we had had enough of this sort of conversation at the ridotto , and I did not expect you would so soon resume it . '' `` What I then said , my sweet reproacher , was the effect of a mistaken , a profane idea , that your understanding held no competition with your beauty ; but now , now that I find you equally incomparable in	1770
Orville 's reception of us was grave and cold : far from distinguishing me , as usual , by particular civilities , Lady Louisa herself could not have seen me enter the room with more frigid unconcern , nor have more scrupulously avoided honouring me with any notice . But chiefly I was struck to see , that he suffered Sir Clement , who stayed supper , to sit between us , without any effort to prevent him , though till then , he had seemed to be even tenacious of a seat next mine . This little circumstance affected me more than I can express ; yet I endeavoured to rejoice	1770
, though they have rendered the path plain , they have left it barren . The candour of my readers I have not the impertinence to doubt , and to their indulgence I am sensible I have no claim ; I have , therefore , only to intreat , that my own words may not pronounce my condemnation ; and that what I have here ventured to say in regard to imitation , may be understood as it is meant , in a general sense , and not be imputed to an opinion of my own originality , which I have not the	1770
no longer insisted upon my dancing . Indeed , the extreme vanity of this man , makes me exert a spirit which I did not , till now , know that I possessed : but I can not endure that he should think me at his disposal . The rest of the evening passed very quietly , as Mr. Smith did not again attempt speaking to me ; except , indeed , after we had left the room and while Madam Duval was seating herself in the coach , he said , in a voice of pique , `` Next time I take the trouble to get any tickets for a young lady , I 'll make a bargain before-hand , that she sha n't turn me over to her grandmother . '' We came home very safe ; and	1770
most affecting terms , to take the charge of her education till she was able to act with propriety for herself ; but , in regard to fortune , he left her wholly dependent on her mother , to whose tenderness he earnestly recommended her . Thus , though he would not , to a woman low-bred and illiberal as Mrs. Evelyn , trust the conduct and morals of his daughter , he nevertheless thought proper to secure to her the respect and duty to which , from her own child , were certainly her due ; but unhappily , it never occurred to him that the mother ,	1770
left me ; -but , clinging to him , `` Oh , Sir , '' cried I , `` will you so soon abandon me ? -am I again an orphan ! -Oh , my dear , my long-lost father , leave me not , I beseech you ! take pity on your child , and rob her not of the parent she so fondly hoped would cherish her ! '' `` You know not what you ask , '' cried he ; `` the emotions which now rend my soul are more than my reason can endure ; suffer me then , to leave you ; -impute it not to unkindness , but think of me as well as thou canst . Lord Orville has behaved nobly ; -I believe he will make thee happy . '' Then , again embracing me , `` God bless	1770
where 's Tom ? '' `` Why , I do n't know ; for he would not stay with me , all as ever I could say : for we met some young gentlemen of his acquaintance , and so he bid me go and look by myself ; for he said , says he , I can divert myself better another way , says he . '' This account being given , away again went this silly young man ; and Mr. Branghton , extremely incensed , said he would go and see after them himself . `` So , now '' , cried Madame Duval	1770
. Lord Orville , I fancy , did not dance at all . He seemed to have a large acquaintance , and joined several different parties : but you will easily suppose , I was not much pleased to see him , in a few minutes after I was gone , walk towards the place I had just left , and bow to and join Mrs. Mirvan ! How unlucky I thought myself , that I had not longer withstood this stranger 's importunities ! The moment we had gone down the dance , I was hastening away from him ; but he stopt me , and said , that I could by no	1770
for that purpose . Fine madamoiselle de Sanserre at least thought him more worthy her regard than any of those , the richness of whose habits made her know were of a higher rank : -- she took particular notice of him , made him dance with her , and said a thousand gallant things to him ; but he could very well have dispensed with hearing them , and found little satisfaction in any thing that deprived him of entertaining his dear Charlotta , who he easily knew by her air and shape from all those who were habited in the same manner . As he doubted not , however , but	1740
him , yet , I allure you , his own behaviour is his best recommendation , and well entitles him to more than I find it in my power to do for him at present . I have been thinking for you , sir , continued he , turning to Horatio , and imagine that the employment I have found you will not be disagreeable to you : -- one of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber to the Chevalier St. George being dead , there is a vacancy , which I will make interest shall be filled by no other than yourself ; -- you seem to be much of the same age with him , and I dare say he will be extremely pleased in the choice	1740
on him the next day to enquire after the state of the wounds he had received . Mademoiselle Charlotta was gone to bed ; but being rouzed by the accident , no sooner was informed by the surgeons , who were immediately sent for , that there was nothing dangerous in the hurts her father had received , than she blessed heaven for making Horatio the instrument of his preservation . The sense the baron seemed to have of this obligation , and the praises he bestowed on the gallant manner in which the young gentleman came to his relief , made her almost ready to flatter herself that fate interested itself in behalf of their love ;	1740
banners of this invincible monarch ! -- What immortal honour has not every private man acquired , who contributed the least part to successes that astonish the whole world ! But notwithstanding his eagerness which carried him thro ' marshes , over mountains , and ways , which to an ordinary traveller would have seemed impassable , he met with several delays in his journey , especially when he got into Germany , where they were extremely scrupulous ; and he was obliged to wait at some towns two or three days before he could obtain passports : he also met several parties of flying horse and dragoons ,	1740
questions concerning the government of England at that time , the battle in which he had been taken , and many other things , to all which the young Horatio answered with so much discretion and politeness , as made the prince say to the baron , you have not flattered this gentleman in your description of him ; for tho ' I believe your friendship ready enough to give a just idea of him , yet , I allure you , his own behaviour is his best recommendation , and well entitles him to more than I find it in my power to do for him	1740
, together with the love she either had or feigned to have for him , afterward gained her an absolute ascendant over him . Every one knows the interest he had with the czar ; and he so far exerted it , as to get this fair favourite lodged in the palace , where she was served with the same state and respect as if she had been his wife . This lady , whose name was Edella , happened to be walking with some of her attendants near where these unfortunate gentlemen were buried , at a time when three of them were dragged to their wretched	1740
in which you have linked yourself with the family of the de Coigney 's ; -- but tell me , continued he , how dare you engage yourself so far without my knowledge ? could you ever hope I would consent to an alliance with de Coigney ? De Coigney ! cried she , much more assured than she had been before the mention of that name , heaven forbid you should have such a thought ! The resolution and disdain with which she spoke these words a little surprized him : what , cried he , have you not encouraged the addresses of young de Coigney , and even proceeded so far as to make his father imagine there required no more than to ask my	1740
when reason gets the better of your passion , I doubt not but you will be just enough to acknowledge you have injured me . She got out of the room with these words , but heard Melanthe still outrageous in her reproaches ; but determined not to answer , made what haste she could into her own chamber , where having shut herself in , she gave a loose to the distraction so unexpected an event must naturally occasion . Pride is a passion so incident to human nature , that there is no breast whatever that has not some share of it ; and it would be to	1740
and , indeed , had it not been for the sanguine hopes that the king would in a short time complete the ruin of the czar , and not only restore them liberty , but also add vengeance to it for the ill treatment they had found in his dominions , few , if any of them , had been able to support the miseries inflicted on them by these inhuman wretches , who , not content with burying them in a manner alive , for the dungeon they were in was deep underground , and allowing them no other food than bread and water once in four and twenty hours ,	1740
certain at last of seeing du Plessis , it would have been rather a pleasure to her ; but her mind suffered much more than her body during this pilgrimage , which she continued in the same manner she had begun till she reached Leghorn , where a ship lying at anchor , and expecting to sail in a few days for Marseilles , she agreed to give a small matter for her passage , the sea-faring-men not paying altogether so much regard to her habit , as the land ones had done . No ill accident intervening , the vessel came safely into her desired port , and Louisa now found herself in the native country of the only person who engrossed her thoughts : as she had heard him say he was of Paris , she supposed that the most likely place to hear news of him ,	1740

It must indeed be confessed he had potent inducements for his return to Paris , to combat against those of continuing in the king of Sweden 's service ; and both by turns appeared so prevalent , that it is uncertain which would have got the better , had not an accident happened , which unhappily determined him in favour of the latter .

But how dangerous is it to depend on one 's own strength , against the force of such united charms ! Dorilaus , who , in the midst of a thousand temptations , had maintained the entire liberty of his heart , and tho ' never insensible of beauty , had never been enslaved by it , was now by charms he least suspected , and at an age when he believed himself proof against all the attacks of love , subdued without knowing that he was so. -- The tender passion stole into his soul by imperceptible degrees , and under the shape	1740
. Melanthe here , as at Vienna , received the visits of all whose birth , fortune , or accomplishments , gave them a pretence ; but there was none who paid them so frequently , or which she encouraged with so much pleasure as those of the count de Bellfleur , a French nobleman belonging to the above-mentioned prince of Conti : she often told Louisa , when they were alone , that there was something in the air and manner of behaviour of this count , which had so perfect a resemblance with that of Henricus , that tho ' it reminded her of that once dear and perfidious man , she could not help admiring and wishing a frequent sight of him . This was spoke at her first acquaintance with	1740
the worst colours they would bear ; yet all was insufficient ! -- Louisa was absent in reality , but her image was ever present to him. -- Whatever company he engaged himself in , whatever amusement he endeavoured to entertain himself with , he could think only of her . -- The Town without her seemed a desart , and every thing in it rather seemed irksome than agreeable ; for several months did he endure this cruel conflict ; but love and nature at last got the victory , and all those considerations which had occasioned the opposition subsided : he found it impossible to recover any tranquility of mind while he continued in this dilemma , and therefore yielded to the strongest	1740
and played well on the bass viol and harpsicord , so that it is hard to say whether he found most satisfaction in hearing her or discoursing with her . But how dangerous is it to depend on one 's own strength , against the force of such united charms ! Dorilaus , who , in the midst of a thousand temptations , had maintained the entire liberty of his heart , and tho ' never insensible of beauty , had never been enslaved by it , was now by charms he least suspected , and at an age when he believed himself proof against all the attacks of love , subdued without knowing that he was so. -- The tender passion	1740
attachment to Melanthe , felt in himself a strong propensity to renew those addresses which her reserved behaviour alone had made him withdraw and carry to another ; but the lady to whom for some days past he had made a shew of devoting himself was present , and he was ashamed to give so glaring an instance of his infidelity , which must in all probability render him the contempt of both . This night , however , lost Melanthe the heart she had thought herself so secure of ; but little suspecting her misfortune , she treated the inconstant count with a tenderness he was far from deserving ; and having transplanted all the affection she once had for Henricus on this new object ,	1740
, with a continuation of the intrigues of some French ladies , and the policy of mademoiselle Coigney in regard of her brother_ . It can not be supposed that either of our young lovers enjoyed much true repose that night , tho ' the fatigue of the dance might naturally require it : the one did but just know herself a lover before she felt the worst torments of that passion in her jealousy ; and the other having been compelled , as it were , to lay open his heart in order to convince his charmer it had no object but herself in view , knew not but his temerity in doing so might be imputed to him as	1740
education you were pleased to bestow on me : I therefore take the liberty of acquainting you , that heaven has raised me a protectress in a lady of quality with whom I now am , as you will see by the date of this , at Aix-la-chappelle . As all the favours I receive from her , or all the good that shall happen during my whole life is , and will be entirely owing to you as the fountain-head , it will be always my inclination , as well as duty , to pay you the tribute of grateful thanks. -- Poor recompence , alas , for all you have done for me ! yet	1740

He had all this time been kissing her with the utmost eagerness , so that with all her struggling she had not been able either to disengage herself from his embrace , or to utter one word ; and he was very near forcing from her	1740
had taken miss with them : -- I then thought proper to open it , believing she had no secrets I might not be entrusted with , and finding it came from you , could do no less than give you this information to prevent your being under any surprize for not receiving answers to your letters .

him directly and presented it to him . Take it for your pains , cried he , you have ventured hard , and well deserve the prize . There was no time for thanks ; the duke , who was almost every where at once , was immediately gone where he found his presence necessary , and Horatio returned to take the place of the dead cornet , doubly animated by the encouragement he had received . This victory opening a way into the elector of Bavaria 's dominions , that poor country was terribly ravaged , no less than 300 towns , villages and castles being utterly consumed by a detachment of horse and dragoons the duke sent for that purpose . Some old officers told Horatio	1740
that city , he mistook his way , and turned into the rue St. Dennis instead of the rue St. Honore , where he had been accustomed to leave his horses and servant. -- He found his error just as he was passing by a large inn , and it being a matter of indifference to him where he put up , would not turn back , but ordered his man to alight here. -- I forgot where I was going , said he , but I suppose the horses will be taken as much care of at this house as where we used to go . I shall see to that , replied the fellow . Horatio stepped into a room to take some refreshment while his servant went to the stable , but had not been there above a minute before he heard	1740
together of all the pleasures of the masquerade : it seems she had over-heard some gallant things between him and the daughter of the count de Granpree , and that gave her the occasion of running into a recapitulation of all the professions of constancy he had made to herself , the proofs she had given him of a too easy belief , and the little regard he now paid to her peace of mind. -- I was obliged to affect a pity for her misfortunes , and gratitude for the trust she reposed in me , tho ' neither the one or the other merited in reality any thing but contempt . One often suffers a good deal from one 's complaisance this way , said Charlotta ; and for my part there is nothing I would more carefully avoid than secrets of this	1740
not seeming to understand me , I should believe there were no grounds for me to forbid you my house ; but , young man , I am not so easily deceived ; and since you oblige me to speak plain , must tell you , I am sorry to find you have entertained any projects , which , if you had the least consulted your reason , you would have known could never be accomplished. -- In fine , Horatio , what you make so great a mystery of , may be explained in three words : -- I wish you well as a friend , but can not think of making you my son : -- I would recompence what you have done for me with any thing but my daughter , and as a proof of my concern for your happiness , I exclude you from all	1740
. Horatio , who had seen something like this between the baron and his mistress , found a great deal of reason in what he said , and promised to be guided by him , especially as he had encouragement enough to hope , by all the treatment he had found from Charlotta , that a declaration of love from him would not offend her beyond forgiveness . From that time forward he therefore began to think in what manner he should first disclose the tender secret to the dear object of his affections : when absent from her he easily found words , but when present , that awe which is inseparable from a real passion struck him entirely dumb ; and whenever he was about to open	1740
entreated mrs. C -- -- ge to permit her to work above stairs , that she might be out of the way of all such solicitations for the future , either from him or any other . This request was easily complied with , and the rather because she , who knew not the strength of her journey-woman 's resolution , nor the principles she had been bred in , was sometimes in fear of losing so great a help to her business , by the temptations that might be offered in a place so much exposed to sight . Mr. B -- -- n no sooner missed her , than he enquired with a	1740
very day. -- She now blamed her own inadvertency in holding any discourse with Horatio , of a nature not proper to be over-heard , in a place so public as the Tuilleries , where others , as well as he , might have possibly been witnesses of what was said . Young monsieur de Coigney suffered little less from the turbulence of his nature , and the mortification it gave his vanity , to find a person , whom he looked upon as every way his inferior , preferred to him . His thoughts were wholly bent on revenge ; but in what manner he should accomplish it , he was for some time uncertain : when he acquainted his father with the discovery he had made , and the resentment he had testified against this unworthy rival , as he called him	1740
to fear . But as smooth as now their fortune seemed , they knew not how soon a storm might rise , and give a sudden interruption to that felicity they enjoyed. -- The charms of Charlotta were every day making new conquests ; and among the number of those who pretended to admire her , how probable was it that some one might be thought worthy by her father , and she be compelled to receive the addresses of a rival . These were reflections too natural not to occur to them both , and whenever they did , could not fail of embittering those sweets the certainty of a mutual affection had otherwise afforded . They had now no trouble from monsieur de Coigney ; his father , in order to make him forget a hopeless	1740
in without enquiring into her character ; and as she seemed not to be desirous of an idle life , she would recommend her to those that should find her work if she stayed with her never so long . This was joyful news to our fair fugitive ; and she blessed heaven for so favourable a beginning of her adventures . The woman was punctual to her promise ; and being acquainted with a very great milliner , soon brought her more work than she could do , without encroaching into those hours nature requires for repose : but she seemed not to regret any fatigue to oblige the person who employed her , and sent home all she did so neat , so curious , and well wrought , that the milliner easily saw she had not been accustomed to do	1740
could not help throwing out some reflections among his companions , very much to the disadvantage of the young lady 's reputation . But these might possibly have blown over , as he had but a small time to vent his malice . His father knowing the violence of his temper , in order to prevent any ill consequences , compelled him to return to his employment ; taking upon himself the management of that business which had brought him so unluckily to Paris . But mademoiselle de Coigney had no sooner been informed by her brother of the discovery he had made , than she doubted not that it was on the score of Horatio that he had met with such ill success in his courtship ;	1740
tumult. -- Tho ' they had now been above a year in Russia , none of them could speak the language well enough to be understood , so could receive no information from the guard , even should they have proved good-natured enough to be willing to satisfy their curiosity , so they all run hastily up to the round tower , whence they easily perceived the town in great confusion , and the people running in such crowds , that in the hurry many were trampled to death in endeavouring to pass the gates : -- at a distance they perceived standards waving	1740
years I went to travel , as well for improvement , as to alleviate that discontent which was occasioned by the sight of another in possession of what I thought was my due. -- Having made the tour of Europe , I took France again in my way home : -- the gallantry and good breeding of these people very much attached me to them ; but what chiefly engaged my continuance here much longer than I had done in any other part , was an acquaintance I had made with a lady called Matilda : she was of a very good family in England , was sent to a monastry merely for the sake of well-grounding her in a religion , the free exercise of which is not allowed at home , and to seclude	1740
from whence he was to go to Oxford , in order to finish his studies in the character of a gentleman-commoner . But when every thing was preparing for this purpose , he came one morning into the chamber of his patron , and throwing himself on his knees -- Think me not , sir , said he , too presuming in the request I am about to make you. -- I know all that I am is yours. -- That I am the creature of your bounty , and that , without being a father , you have done more for me than many of those , who are so , do for their most favourite sons. -- I know also that you are the best judge of what is fit for me , and have not the least apprehensions	1740
as often assured her that nothing should either tempt or provoke her to abuse that generous friendship she had testified for her ; but as she was not able to command her countenance , tho ' she could her words , she resolved to pretend herself indisposed and keep her bed , that she might be the less observed , or the change in her should seem rather the effects of ill health than any secret discontent . It was no sooner mentioned in the convent that she was out of order , than the abbess herself , as well as the whole sisterhood , came to her chamber , and shewed the greatest concern : the tender care they took of her would have	1740
to him ; but all his endeavours to give him any farther light into it being unsuccessful ; he began to imagine the parents of the children had been compelled by necessity to expose them , and had had only wrote in this mysterious manner to engage a better reception : he also accounted in his mind for their being left with him , as , he being a batchelor , and having a large estate , it might naturally be supposed there would be fewer impediments to their being taken care of , than either where a wife was in the case , or a narrow fortune obliged the owner to preserve a greater oeconomy in expences . Being at last convinced within himself that he had now explained this seeming riddle , he took no farther	1740
how the lady they were speaking of threw herself upon him , and afterwards enjoined him to deliver the message . But , added he , I think last night was one of the most unfortunate ones I have ever known , since , with all the care I could take , I was continually prevented by other people 's concerns from prosecuting my own. -- I was not only insulted and reproached for being mistaken for some other person , for it could happen no other way , but also soon after received a letter no less mysterious to me than the blow	1740
into the room ! and after paying his respects to Melanthe in the most submissive manner , accosted her , with saying he took the liberty of enquiring of her health after the fatigue of the last night ; but , added he , the question , now I have the happiness of seeing you , is altogether needless ; those fine eyes , and that sprightly air , declare you formed for everlasting gaiety , and that what is apt to throw the spirits of others into a languor , serves but to render yours more sparkling . Louisa , in spite of the	1740
have defended his heart from the invasions of any other charms ; but he needed not that pre-engagement to make him look with detestation on a woman of Mattakesa 's principles : -- when he reflected on what she had said concerning Edella , he found her base , censorious , and unjust : -- and when he considered the manner in which she proceeded in regard to himself , he saw a lewdness and audacity which rendered her doubly odious , to him : -- he doubted not but she was wicked and subtle enough to contrive some means of revenging herself , in	1740
, and all the obstacles nature had thrown in the way of this conqueror ; and whenever they came to any battle , was so swift in bearing his commands to the general , and in returning to him in which line soever he was , that Poniatosky gave him the name of the Mercury to their Jove ; nor did he less signalize his valour ; he fought by the side of the king like one who valued not life , in competition with the praises of his master . In an engagement where they took the baggage of Augustus , he did extraordinary service ; and a colonel then being	1740
had been insensible of the vast disparity there was at present between him and the noble family of de Palfoy : he could expect no other , or rather worse treatment than what he had now received , if his passion was ever discovered , and had no excuse to make for what himself allowed so great a presumption . With a countenance dejected , and a heart oppressed with various agitations , did he quit the house which contained what was most valuable to him in the world , while poor Charlotta endured , if possible , a greater shock . The baron de Palfoy , now convinced that all he had been informed of was true , was more incensed against her than he had been on the mistaken supposition of her being influenced in favour	1740
pencil , which made some alteration in the fineness of the strokes , convinced him it came from no other than Charlotta ; and never were any hours so tedious to him as those which past between the receiving this appointment , and that of the fulfilling it . At length the wish'd-for time arrived , and he repaired to the gate , where telling the portress , as he was ordered , that he was the brother of mademoiselle du Pont , he was immediately brought into the parlour , where he had not waited long before a young	1740
life : -- the greatness of her spirit , and the most perfect resignation to the divine will , however , made her support even this last and severest trial with fortitude and patience ; and as soon as she had put herself into a convenient neat garb , but plain , befitting her condition , she went out with a design to take a private lodging , where she might live more cheaply than she could at the hotel , till providence should throw some person in the way that might recommend her either to work , or to teach young ladies music . She was wandering thro ' several of the streets of Paris , without being able , as yet , to find such a chamber as she wanted , when a great shower of rain happening to fall , she stood up under	1740

ought not to falsify his word , tho ' given to an unworthy person , that she was at last won to forgive his having undertaken to mention any thing to her of the nature he had done . Indeed , the agitations she had been in were more owing to the vexation that monsieur du Plessis was the person employed , than that the count had the boldness to apply to her in this manner ; but the submission she found herself treated with by the former , convincing her that he had sentiments very different from those the other had entertained of her , rendered	1740
to monsieur the prince of Conti , to whom he gave such an advantageous description of the courage and accomplishments of the English cornet , and the inclination he had to stay among them , that his highness told the baron , that he might acquaint him from him , that if he were willing to serve under him he should have a commission ; or , if he rather chose a civil employment , he would use his interest to procure him such a one as might afford both honour and profit . This the baron did not fail to communicate immediately to Horatio , who , charm 'd with the generosity both	1740
a lady to whom their affections were given , could not help sympathizing in the misfortunes of two persons who seemed to have fallen into them merely by the sincere attachment they had for each other . CHAP . XVIII . _King Stanislaus quits Alranstadt to appease the troubles in Poland : Charles XII . gives laws to the empire : a courier arrives from Paris : Horatio receives letters which give him great surprize_ . Augustus being able to obtain no better conditions from the king of Sweden , than leave to return to his almost ruined electorate , took leave of his conqueror with an almost broken heart. -- Intelligence soon after arriving that Poland was half demolished by the violence of different factions , who , in the absence of	1740
bounds , were I not conscious how far I have been unworthy of it ; and that I fear the same goodness , always partial to me , may have in this paper ( meaning the letter ) endeavoured to give the general an idea of me which I may not be able to preserve . I look upon myself to be the best judge of that , replied the baron with a smile ; and you may remember , that on a very different occasion I saw into your sentiments before you were well acquainted with the nature of them yourself . As Horatio knew these words referred to the discourse that	1740
her for all the favours she had received from her , acknowledging them to be as unmerited as her late displeasure , which she conjured her to believe she had never , even in thought , done any thing justly to incur ; -- wished her prosperity , and that she might never find a person less faithful to her interests than she had been . Having desired her woman to deliver this to her , she took leave of the servants , who all loved her extremely , and saw her go with tears in their eyes . The rout she intended to take was to Padua by water , thence in a post chaise to Leghorn , where she was informed , it would be easy to find a ship bound for England ;	1740
her . During the time of her feigned illness , her thoughts were always employed on the means of getting away . Whenever Leonora and she were together , a hundred contrivances were formed , which seemed equally alike impracticable ; but at length they hit upon one which had a promising aspect and Louisa , after some scruples , resolved to make trial of . It was this : As hypocrisy was made use of to detain her , hypocrisy was the only method by which she could hope to get her liberty : -- pretending , therefore , to be all at once restored to her former health , she sent to entreat the abbess , and some other of the most zealous of the sisterhood to come into her chamber , where , as soon as they entered , they found	1740
One day as they were sitting together , discoursing on the usual topics with which they entertained each other , and endeavoured to beguile the tedious time , they heard a confused noise as of some sudden tumult. -- Tho ' they had now been above a year in Russia , none of them could speak the language well enough to be understood , so could receive no information from the guard , even should they have proved good-natured enough to be willing to satisfy their curiosity , so they all run hastily up to the round tower , whence they easily perceived the town in great confusion , and the people running in such crowds , that in the hurry many were trampled to death in endeavouring to pass the gates : -- at a distance they perceived standards waving in the air , but could not yet distinguish	1740
equally ineffectual ; nor could even the thoughts of the beautiful princess Louisa , his betrothed spouse , and whom he was to marry at the end of this war , put a stop to the vehemence of his impatience to revenge the many injuries he had received from the czar of Muscovy . These were the sentiments by which this conquering monarch were agitated ; but Horatio , tho ' no less fond of glory , had a softness in his nature , which made him languish for the sight of his dear Charlotta , whom he had been absent from near two years ; and being now blessed with a fortune from the plunder of	1740
, she had left the care of that entirely to Dorilaus . She was one morning very much lost in thought on the odd circumstances of her fortune , when a Gazette happening to lye upon the table , she cast her eye , without design , upon the following advertisement . 'Whereas a young gentlewoman has lately thought fit to abscond from her best friends , and with the most diligent search that could possibly be made after her has not yet been heard of , this is to acquaint her that if she pleases to return , she shall hereafter have no disturbance of that nature which it is supposed occasioned her withdrawing herself , but live entirely according to	1740
he , kissing her hard , I never shall complain . Me ! interrupted she , pretending the utmost astonishment , and drawing her chair somewhat farther from him . Yes , beautiful Louisa , resumed he ; it is you alone who have been capable of teaching me what love truly is : -- your eyes , at first sight , subdued my heart ; but your virtue has since made a conquest of my soul : -- if I dare hope to make you mine , it is only by such ways as heaven , and those who have the power of disposing you , shall approve : -- in the mean time I implore no more	1740
sudden thoughtfulness , which the other at that time took no notice of , but it served afterwards to corroborate the truth of something she was told , and proved of consequence little to be foreseen . The inconstant count , in the mean time , satieted with Melanthe , and as much in love with Louisa as a man of his temper could be , was contriving all the ways his inventive wit could furnish him with to get handsomely rid of the one , and attain the enjoyment of the other . As he had spent many years in a continual	1740
and , after some little preparation , proposed a match between his son and mademoiselle de Palfoy . The baron was not at all surprized at what he said , because he expected , if the young people were kept asunder , an offer would be made of this kind ; and after hearing calmly all he had to say , in order to induce him to give his consent , he told him , that he was very sorry he had asked a thing which it was impossible to grant , because he had already determined to dispose otherwise of his daughter . Monsieur de	1740
no more ; and for a time every thing passed smoothly and agreeably on ; but news after news continually arriving of the king of Sweden 's ill success in Ukrania , rendered all the noble friends of Horatio extremely dissatisfied : -- the public accounts were too deficient for their information of any particular officer , and as there were very few French in the Swedish army , they could hope for no intelligence of him but from himself ; which , as he omitted giving , they at last concluded he was either killed or taken prisoner ; which last misfortune they looked upon as equal with the former : -- the Russian barbarity , and their manner of treating those whom the chance of war threw into their hands , was	1740
now considered that the discovery she had to make would only render this indiscreet lady more unhappy , and therefore no longer thought herself obliged to run any risque of incuring her ill-will on the occasion ; but in her soul extremely lamented this second fall from virtue , which it was impossible should not bring on consequences equally , if not more shameful than the first . Good God ! cried she , how is it possible for a woman of any share of sense , and who has been blessed with a suitable education , to run thus counter to all the principles of religion , honour , virtue , modesty , and all that is valuable in our sex ? and yet that many do , I have been a melancholy witness : -- and then again , what is there in this love , resumed	1740
it from me ; and perhaps your own , if you seem to be acquainted with it at all . It is not to be doubted but Louisa gave her all the assurances she could desire of an inviolable secrecy ; after which , know then , resumed this sweet-condition 'd lady , that your lover , monsieur du Plessis , is not only living , but as faithful as your soul can wish , or as you once believed : -- the cruelty of the abbess , and some of the sisterhood in the plot with her , have concealed the letters he has sent to you , in order to persuade you to become a nun : -- I tremble to think of their hypocrisy and deceit : -- but what , continued she , is not to be expected from bigotry and enthusiasm ! -- To	1740
his ruined and almost expiring wife ! After having satiated their wicked will , they left us , bound as we were , where we continued the remainder of the day and whole night , and had doubtless perished thro ' hunger and extreme cold , if a second party had not passed that way , who having been out on a maroding , were then returning to the camp. -- Being actuated by somewhat more compassion than the former , one of the officers made us be untied , and having heard our story , blamed the cruelty with which we had been treated , and brought us to his tent , the same we now are in , and ordered something should be given for our refreshment ; but my lady has continued obstinate to dye , and to that end has refused all subsistence . This	1740
acquaint her with , -- dear sister , cried she , I bring you the most surprising news , but such as will be my ruin if you take the least notice of receiving it from me ; and perhaps your own , if you seem to be acquainted with it at all . It is not to be doubted but Louisa gave her all the assurances she could desire of an inviolable secrecy ; after which , know then , resumed this sweet-condition 'd lady , that your lover , monsieur du Plessis , is not only living , but as faithful as your soul can wish , or as you once believed : -- the cruelty of the abbess , and some of the sisterhood in the plot with her , have concealed the letters he has sent to you , in order to persuade you to	1740
secrets of the government : -- being prisoners of war , you formed contrivances for your escape , and attempted to inveigle others to accompany your flight . That every tittle of this accusation is false , my lord , cried Horatio , there needs no more than the improbability of it to prove. -- Indeed the cruel usage we sustained , might have justified an attempt to free ourselves , yet did such a design never enter our heads : -- we were so far from making use of any stratagems for that purpose , that we never made the least overture to any of the guards , who were the only persons we were allowed to converse with . How ! said the prince interrupting him , were not your privileges enlarged by the interposition of a lady ? -- Did she not make you considerable	1740
; nor did any of them make any mention of that lady , tho ' he knew the passion he had for her was now no secret to any of them . He was very much surprized that the baron de Palfoy had not wrote , because as he had in a manner promised to correspond with him by desiring him to write , he had a right to expect that favour when they came to Alranstadt ; for till then it was scarce possible , by reason of the army 's continual and uncertain motions ; but he was much more so , that the baron de la Valiere had not been so good as to give him some information of an affair , of which he could not be insensible his peace so much depended : that he did not do it , he therefore	1740
if you have a serious Intention of doing what you seemed to hint at , will contribute all I can to forward you . Ah sir ! cried Horatio , falling at his feet , impute not , I beseech you , this desire in me to any thing but the extreme desire I have to render myself worthy of the favours you have been pleased to confer upon me , and to be able to serve you whenever any happy occasion shall present itself . No more , Horatio , replied the chevalier , with a sweetness and affability peculiar to himself ; I am perfectly assured of your duty and affection to me , and am so far from taking	1740
the question , now I have the happiness of seeing you , is altogether needless ; those fine eyes , and that sprightly air , declare you formed for everlasting gaiety , and that what is apt to throw the spirits of others into a languor , serves but to render yours more sparkling . Louisa , in spite of the confusion she felt within , answered this compliment with her accustomed ease ; and being all seated , they began to enter into some conversation concerning the state with which the Magnifico 's of Venice are served , the	1740
his return from Marli , the violence of her temper made her break out into such reproaches and exclamations , as a man had need be very much in love to endure : he endeavoured to make her sensible of her error by a thousand protestations ; but the more he talk 'd of Marli and the king 's command , the more she told him of Charlotta and the masquerade ; and almost distracted to find he still persisted in denying he was there , or had ever made any tender professions to that lady , she proceeded to such extravagancies as he , who knew	1740
over-heard by the prince , who turning hastily about , instead of putting the money into his own pocket , presented it to him , saying , I am doubly indebted to chance , sir , which has made me master of this ; since it may be of service to you , I beseech you therefore to accept it with the respects of a prince , whose greatest pleasure in life is to oblige a worthy person . It would take up too much time to expatiate on the grateful acknowledgments made by the Venetian , or the admiration which the report of this action being	1740
confidence . From this time forward he behaved to him with a coldness which was sufficient to convince the other of the motive , especially as he found mademoiselle de Coigney took all opportunities of throwing the most picquant reflections on him . It is certain that lady was so full of spight at the indignity she thought her family had received , that she could not help whispering the attachment of Horatio and Charlotta , not only at St. Germains , but at Paris also , with inunendo 's little less cruel than those her brother had made use of to his companions ; so that between them , the amour was talked of among all who were acquainted with either of them . At length the report reached	1740
you can do in no better a manner than by telling the truth , and as I am already sufficiently acquainted with the whole , will leave you to relate it , while I dispatch a little business that at present calls me hence . He went out of the room in speaking this , and Louisa had a more full opportunity of informing her lover of all she had suffered since their parting , till this happy change in her fortune , than she could have had in the presence of her father , tho ' no stranger to her most inmost thoughts on this occasion . The pleasing story of her pilgrimage rehearsed , how did the charmed du Plessis	1740
testified his resentment , had not the excess of his love , which is ever accompanied with an adequate share of respect , obliged him to stifle it . Well , Louisa , said he , looking earnestly upon her , ungenerously do you requite what I have done for you ; but I , perhaps , may bring myself to other sentiments. -- None , interrupted she , emboldened by the too great freedom she thought he had taken with her , can be so dreadful to me as those you now seem to entertain . The look he gave her on hearing her speak in this manner , made her immediately repent having been so open ; and in the same breath , because ;	1740
governor in their behalf : -- they acknowledged she had been so good as to come sometimes to the prison , in order to see if those she entrusted with her bounty had been faithful in the delivery of it ; but that she never made the least difference between them , and never had conversation with any one of them that was not in the presence of them all . Mullern could not forbear adding to this , that he doubted not but the persons who had incensed his highness into groundless surmises , were also the same who	1740
observed , deny him those praises which I have heard you bestow very freely on persons that have not half his merit . Louisa knowing how vain it was to contest with inclination , in persons who are resolved to indulge it , and also that all advice was now too late , began to repent of what she said . If , madam , replied she , after a little pause , I have seemed unjust to the count 's perfections , it was only because I feared you were but too sensible of them ; for otherwise , it must be owned ,	1740
he followed the advice of his sister , and too soon to be received in a manner agreeable to his wishes by a lady of Charlotta 's modesty and delicacy , even had she not been prepossessed in favour of another ; for tho ' she respected him as the brother of her friend , that consideration was too weak to hinder her from letting him know how displeasing his pretensions were to her , and that if he persisted in them she should be obliged to refuse seeing him any more . He was now sensible of his error , and endeavoured to excuse it by the violence of his passion , which he said would not suffer him to conceal what he felt ; but as , when a heart is truly devoted to one object , the sound	1740
was that gave it him . He put it however in his pocket , designing to read it at more leisure , his curiosity for the contents not equalling his desire of entertaining mademoiselle Charlotta ; but that young lady , whose jealousy received new fewel from this object , had slipt away before he could turn from the man , and had already mixed with a cluster of both sexes who had got into the room before them . Horatio finding all attempts to speak to her that night would be ineffectual , went back into the drawing-room where	1740
manifest a neglect , Mullern drew near to her , and beginning to speak of the beauties of that fine city which the czar had erected in the midst of war , he told her , that having a little skill in drawing , he had ventured to make a little sketch of it in chalk on the walls of the room where he lay , and entreated her in the most gallant manner to look upon it , and give him her opinion how far he had done justice to an edifice so much admired . It can not be supposed that Mattakesa had in her soul any curiosity to see	1740
he , there is a person , meaning monsieur du Plessis , who is just come in , and says she has no husband , and belongs to an English lady of quality now at Venice : -- I will therefore take care of her this night , and if you have any real claim to her , you may make it out before the magistrate to-morrow . The count was so enraged to find it had been by monsieur du Plessis he had been disappointed , that he snatched his sword from Louisa , who had all this time held it in her hand , and made so furious a thrust at him , that , had he not been more than ordinary nimble in avoiding it , by stepping aside , it must have infallibly gone	1740
being utterly consumed by a detachment of horse and dragoons the duke sent for that purpose . Some old officers told Horatio that now would be the time to make his fortune if he went with these squadrons , there being many rich things which would fall to the share of the plunderers ; to which he answered , that he came to fight for the honour of his country , and not to rob for its disgrace . This they laughed at , and endeavoured to make him sensible , that the taking away an enemy 's treasure was to take away their strength ; but all they could	1740
of a person whom , of all the world , she could least have expected in that place , made her at first start back ; and conscious shame for having , as she thought , so ill rewarded his goodness , mixed with a certain awe which she had for no other person but himself , occasioned such a trembling , as rendered her unable either to retire or move forward to salute him , as she otherwise would have done . He saw the confusion she was in , and willing to give it an immediate relief , ran to her , and taking her in his arms , -- my dear , dear child , said he , am I so happy to see thee once more ! -- Oh ! sir , returned she disengaging herself from his	1740
compliments to the lady for her generous assistance which it merited from him ; but she easily forgave any unpoliteness he might be guilty of on that score ; and he so well attoned for it after he had given vent to the sudden emotions of his joy , that she looked , upon him as the most accomplished , as well as the most faithful of his sex . They had entered into some discourse of the rules of the monastry , and how impossible it would have been for him to have gained an interview with mademoiselle Charlotta , but by the means she had contrived ; -- she told him	1740
all the foot , while the troops under the command of general Renchild and Hoorn , galloped round thro ' the morrass in which that river ended , and both together charged the enemy , who , after some faint shew of resistance , fled with the utmost precipitation . The whole army being now joined marched on toward the Boristhenes , but with fatigues which are impossible to be described : Horatio kept still close to the king , and whether he fought or marched , was on foot or on horsback , was always in his fight ready to bear his commands to the generals , or assist him in the time of danger . More than once had the conqueror been indebted to this young warrior , for turning the point of the destructive sword from giving him the same death he was dealing about to others	1740
expressing their grief at this misfortune : -- the shock of it was so violent , it even took away the power of feeling it , and they remained for some moments rather like statues carv 'd out by mortal art , than real men created by God , and animated with living souls . A general groan was the first mark they gave of any sensibility of this dreadful stroke of fate ; but when recruited spirits once more gave utterance to words , how terrible were their exclamations ! Some of them , in the extravagance of despair , said things relating to fate and destiny , which , on a less occasion , could have little merited forgiveness . Unable either to remove from the place , or view distinctly what their eyes were fixed upon , they stayed till the whole	1740
; -- and the brave , the virtuous du Plessis , may have fallen a victim in common with the most vulgar . These apprehensions had no sooner gained ground in her imagination , than she became the most disconsolate creature in the world . The abbess took advantage of her melancholy , as knowing the occasion of it , and began to represent , in the strongest terms , the instability of all human expectations : -- you may easily see , my dear child , said she , that monsieur either no longer lives , or ceases to live for you : -- young men are wavering , every new object attracts their wishes ; -- they	1740
over , they all returned to the ballroom ; and Horatio having contrived it so as to get next Charlotta , she could not refuse the offer he made her of his hand to lead her in ; but as he was about saying something to her in a low voice , a man came hastily to him , and taking him a little on one side , presented him with a letter , and then retired with so much precipitation , that Horatio could neither ask from whom it came , nor well discern what sort of person it was that gave it him . He put it however in his pocket , designing to read it at more leisure , his curiosity for the contents not equalling his desire of entertaining mademoiselle Charlotta ; but that young lady , whose jealousy received new fewel from this	1740
' the streets in order to go to the inn where his servant and horses waited for him , when he heard the clashing of swords at some distance from him : guided by his generosity , he flew to the place where the noise directed him , and saw by the lights , which hang out very thick in that city , one person defending himself against three who pressed very hard upon him , and had got him down just as Horatio arrived to his relief : he ran among the assaillants ; and either the greatness of his courage , or the belief that others would come to his assistance , threw them into such a consternation , that they all sought their safety in their flight , while the person they had attacked got up again and thanked his deliverer , without whose	1740
he continued in it some months . A little time before his departure an accident happened , which gave him an opportunity of exercising the benevolence of his disposition ; and , tho ' it then seemed trivial to him , proved of the utmost consequence to his future life , as well as furnished matter for the following pages . As he was walking pretty early one morning in his garden , very intent on a book he had in his hand , his meditations were interrupted by an unusual cry , which seemed at some distance ; but as he approached a little arbour , where he was sometimes accustomed to sit , he heard more plain and distinct , and on his entrance was soon convinced whence	1740
the baron artfully kept her in the most severe restraint under a shew of liberty ; pretending to her , as he had done to the princess , that he was not well enough to go abroad , he would stay at home whole days together , and oblige her to read , or play to him on the spinnet , which frequently she did with an aking heart ; and when she went out , it was always in company with a relation whom he kept at his house on purpose , as he said , as a companion to divert her , but in reality to be a spy over all her	1740
, and to entreat his highness 's protection against any attempts he might be safe enough to make . She was just sitting down , in order to form a remonstrance of this kind , when a chariot and six stopping at the door , she was informed the gentleman who had sent to her was come in person , and that they knew it was the same by the livery. -- Louisa run hastily to the window and saw a person alight , whom , by the bulk and stature , she knew could not be the count she so much dreaded , this having much the advantage of the other in both . Somewhat reassured by this sight , she ordered the master of the hotel to desire him to walk into a parlour , and let him know she would	1740
not the strength of her journey-woman 's resolution , nor the principles she had been bred in , was sometimes in fear of losing so great a help to her business , by the temptations that might be offered in a place so much exposed to sight . Mr. B -- -- n no sooner missed her , than he enquired with a good deal of earnestness for her ; and on mrs. C -- -- ge 's telling him she was gone away from her house , became so impatient to know where , and on what account she had left her	1740
might probably have lived a long time together in the contentment they now enjoyed , had not an accident , of which neither of them could have any notion , put a stop to it . Horatio thought no more on the affair of madame de Olonne and monsieur de Coigney , from the time he had been cleared of having any concern with that lady , yet was that night 's adventure productive of what he looked upon as the greatest misfortune could befal him . But to make this matter conspicuous to the reader , it is necessary to give a brief detail of the circumstances that led to it . This lady , who was wife to the baron de Olonne , was one of the most beautiful , and most vicious women in the kingdom ; she entertained a great number of lovers ;	1740
a description of the habit I should wear ; but instead of making any excuse for a first transgression , you hurry to a second , and pay all your devoirs to another , whom indeed I knew not at that time , but am since informed she is one of the maids of honour to princess Louisa. -- I must confess I had not resolution enough to suffer so cruel an injustice , and being too much overcome by my passion to resent it as I ought , I left the place , and desired our friend to do it for me. -- I find she somewhat exceeded her commission , but you must forgive her , since it was her love for me : -- I am now at her house , where I impatiently expect you --	1740
he could by no means comprehend. -- It seemed impossible to him there could be any reasons prevalent enough to make him quit , with honour , a prince who had so liberally rewarded his service ; but hoping a further explanation , he lost not any time in conjectures ; and tearing open the other letter without giving himself time to examine the hand in which it was directed , found , to his inexpressible astonishment , the name of Dorilaus subscribed . It was indeed wrote by that gentleman , and contained at follows : _Dear Horatio_ , `` Accidents , which at our parting neither of us could foresee , have doubtless long since made you cease to hope any continuance of that	1740
not be supposed that Mattakesa had in her soul any curiosity to see a work of this nature , yet , to hide as much as she could the disorder she was in at her disappointment , gave him her hand , in order to be concluded to the place where he pretended to have been exercising his genius . As soon as they were entered he threw the door , as if by incident , which having a spring lock , immediately was made fast -- She either did not , or seemed not to regard what he had	1740
the good fortune to arrive on the very day that Stanislaus and his queen were crowned , and was witness of part of the ceremony . The king of Sweden was there incognito , and being shewn to Horatio , he could not forbear testifying his surprize to see so great a prince , and one who , in every action of his life , discovered a magnamity even above his rank , habited in a manner not to be distinguished from a private man ; but it was not in the power of any garb to take from him a look of majesty , which shewed him born to command not only his own subjects , but kings themselves , when they presumed to become his enemies . There was a fierceness in his eyes , but tempered with so much sweetness , that it was impossible	1740
the dropping her letter , was a fiction , it was however an ingenious one , and shewed his wit , as well as love , in bringing both himself and friend off in so handsome a manner . She was infatuated with the praises he gave her ; -- the pathetic expressions he made use of , assured her of the ardency of his desires , and as she could not be certain of being able to inspire Horatio with the same , she wisely chose to accept the present offer , rather than wait for what might perhaps at last deceive her expectations . She made , however , no immediate answer ; but her eyes told him she was far from being displeased with what he had said , and gave him courage to take up one of her hands and kiss it	1740
, in order to alleviate his melancholy , in the company of some young gentlemen , who had expressed a very great regard for him ; but his mind being taken up with various and perplexed thoughts on his entrance into that city , he mistook his way , and turned into the rue St. Dennis instead of the rue St. Honore , where he had been accustomed to leave his horses and servant. -- He found his error just as he was passing by a large inn , and it being a matter of indifference to him where he put up , would not turn back , but ordered his man to alight here. -- I forgot where I was going , said he , but I suppose the horses will be taken as much care of at this house as	1740
had now a second opportunity of writing to France , which he did not fail to do , and , as there was no talk of the army decamping for some time , let his friends know he hoped to hear from them at Alranstadt . Augustus , in the mean time deprived of every thing , and a wanderer in that kingdom where he had lately reigned , sent a mean submission to him , entreating peace , and that he might have leave to return to his electorate . This was granted by the conqueror , on condition he	1740
, and desired our friend to do it for me. -- I find she somewhat exceeded her commission , but you must forgive her , since it was her love for me : -- I am now at her house , where I impatiently expect you -- The baron is secure for some hours ; -- those we may pass together , if you still think there is any thing worth quitting the masquerade for , to be found in the arms of _Yours_ , & c , _P.S._ If you now fail , no excuse hereafter shall ever plead your pardon . ' This letter confirmed Horatio in the belief he had before ,	1740
the least anxious for an explanation of any farther good . To tell you with how much ardency I long to throw myself at your feet , to relate to you all the various accidents that have befallen me since first you condescended to put me in the paths of glory , and to pour out my soul before you with thanksgiving , would be as impossible as it is for me at present to enjoy that blessing ! -- The king 's affairs , it is true , would suffer nothing by my absence ; but , sir , what would the world say of me , if , after a whole	1740
of mind while he continued in this dilemma , and therefore yielded to the strongest side . All the arguments he had used with himself in the beginning of his passion seemed now weak and trifling : the difference of age , which he had thought so formidable an objection , appeared none in the light with which he at present considered it : he was now but in his fortieth year , and the temperance he had always observed had hindered any decay either in his looks or constitution. -- What censures the world might pass on his marrying one of her age and obscure birth , he thought were of little weight when balanced with his internal peace. -- Thus was he enabled to answer to himself all that could be offered against making her his wife ; and	1740
usual extent , even in more serene weather . For we must not only have regard to the mist which happens to be in the place where we stand ; we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of vapours and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon : all which cooperating to render the appearance of the moon more faint , and thereby increase its magnitude , it may chance to appear greater than it usually does , even in the horizontal position , at a time when , though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness , just in the place where we stand , yet the air between the eye and the moon , taken all together , may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed vapours and exhalations than at other times	1700
not greater in the horizon than in the meridian , so neither is it thought to be so . It hath been already shown that in any act of vision the visible object absolutely , or in itself , is little taken notice of , the mind still carrying its view from that to some tangible ideas which have been observed to be connected with it , and by that means come to be suggested by it . So that when a thing is said to appear great or small , or whatever estimate be made of the magnitude of any thing , this is meant not of the visible but of the tangible object . This duly considered , it will be no hard matter to reconcile	1700
to perceive them , yet these principles would not be found sufficient to explain the PHENOMENA of DISTANCE , as shall be shown hereafter . 16 . Now , it being already shown that distance is suggested to the mind by the mediation of some other IDEA which is itself perceived in the act of seeing , it remains that we inquire what IDEAS or SENSATIONS there be that attend VISION , unto which we may suppose the IDEAS of distance are connected , and by which they are introduced into the mind . And FIRST , it is certain by experience that when we look at a near OBJECT with both eyes , according as it approaches or recedes from us , we alter the disposition of our eyes , by lessening or	1700
the intermediate distances , the inch shall have a different visible extension , i.e . there shall be more or fewer points discerned in it . Now I ask which of all these various extensions is that stated , determinate one that is agreed on for a common measure of other magnitudes ? No reason can be assigned why we should pitch on one more than another : and except there be some invariable , determinate extension fixed on to be marked to the word inch , it is plain it can be used to little purpose ; and to say a thing contains this or that number of inches shall imply no more than	1700
Dr. Wallis , wherein he attempts to account for that phenomenon which , though it seems not to contain anything new or different from what had been said before by others , I shall nevertheless consider in this place . 76 . His opinion , in short , is this ; we judge not of the magnitude of an object by the visual angle alone , but by the visual angle in conjunction with the distance . Hence , though the angle remain the same , or even become less , yet if withal the distance seem to have been increased , the object shall appear greater	1700
which are the proper and immediate object of sight , are not without the mind . But then it will be said , by sight we have also the ideas of extension , and figure , and motion ; all which may well be thought without , and at some distance from the mind , though colour should not . In answer to this I appeal to any man 's experience , whether the visible extension of any object doth not appear as near to him as the colour of that object ; nay , whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place	1700
letters whereby it is marked are of the same species because they are both called by the same name . It is customary to call written words and the things they signify by the same name : for words not being regarded in their own nature , or otherwise than as they are marks of things , it had been superfluous , and beside the design of language , to have given them names distinct from those of the things marked by them . The same reason holds here also . Visible figures are the marks of tangible figures , and from sect . 59	1700
is nearest the earth , and what part farthest from it , i.e . whether he be erect or inverted . 102 . To which I answer , the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man are entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth and man . Nor was it possible , by virtue of the visive faculty alone , without superadding any experience of touch , or altering the position of the eye , ever to have known , or so much as suspected , there had been any relation or connexion between them . Hence a man at first view would not denominate anything he saw earth , or	1700
the moon , taken all together , may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed vapours and exhalations than at other times . 72 . It may be objected that in consequence of our principles the interposition of a body in some degree opaque , which may intercept a great part of the rays of light , should render the appearance of the moon in the meridian as large as when it is viewed in the horizon . To which I answer , it is not faintness anyhow applied that suggests greater magnitude , there being no necessary but only an experimental connexion between those two things . It follows that the faintness which enlarges	1700
thoughts and examine what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a distance , will agree with me that what he sees only suggests to his understanding that after having passed a certain distance , to be measured by the motion of his body , which is perceivable by touch , he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas . But that one might be deceived by these suggestions of sense , and that there is no necessary connexion between visible and tangible ideas suggested by them , we need go no farther than the next looking-glass or pictures to be convinced . Note that when I speak of tangible ideas , I take the word idea for any the immediate object of sense or understanding , in which large signification	1700
each other . Now , it is natural to inquire which of these is the object of geometry . 150 . Some things there are which at first sight incline one to think geometry conversant about visible extension . The constant use of the eyes , both in the practical and speculative parts of that science , doth very much induce us thereto . It would , without doubt , seem odd to a mathematician to go about to convince him the diagrams he saw upon paper were not the figures , or even the likeness of the figures , which make the subject of the demonstration . The contrary being held an unquestionable truth , not only by mathematicians , but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic ; I mean , who consider the nature of science ,	1700
to mark each particular difference or part of the whole sound . And yet nobody , I presume , will say the single letter a , or the word ADULTERY , are like unto , or of the same species with , the respective sounds by them represented . It is indeed arbitrary that , in general , letters of any language represent sounds at all : but when that is once agreed , it is not arbitrary what combination of letters shall represent this or that particular sound . I leave this with the reader to pursue , and apply it in his own thoughts . 144 . It must be confessed that we are not so apt to confound other signs with the things signified , or to think them of the same species , as we are visible and tangible ideas	1700
to him as the colour of that object ; nay , whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place . Is not the extension we see coloured , and is it possible for us , so much as in thought , to separate and abstract colour from extension ? Now , where the extension is there surely is the figure , and there the motion too . I speak of those which are perceived by sight . 44 . But for a fuller explication of this point , and to show that the immediate objects of sight are not so much	1700
shows it to be most convenient : without which our ideas had never been collected into such sundry distinct combinations as they now are . 110 . Hence it follows that a man born blind and afterwards , when grown up , made to see , would not in the first act of vision parcel out the ideas of sight into the same distinct collections that others do , who have experienced which do regularly coexist and are proper to be bundled up together under one name . He would not , for example , make into one complex idea , and thereby esteem an unit , all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot . For there can be no reason assigned why he should do so , barely upon his seeing a man stand upright before him . There crowd into his	1700
. It does not in the least depend upon experience , but may be evidently known by anyone before he had experienced it , that the nearer the concurrence of the OPTIC AXES , the greater the ANGLE , and the remoter their concurrence is , the lesser will be the ANGLE comprehended by them . 6 . There is another way mentioned by optic writers , whereby they will have us judge of those distances , in respect of which the breadth of the PUPIL hath any sensible bigness : And that is the greater or lesser divergency of the rays , which issuing from the visible point do fall on	1700
this planeness of the picture , is not perceived immediately by vision : for it appeareth to the eye various and multiform . 158 . From all which we may conclude that planes are no more the immediate object of sight than solids . What we strictly see are not solids , nor yet planes variously coloured : they are only diversity of colours . And some of these suggest to the mind solids , and other plane figures , just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or the other : so that we see planes in the same way that we see solids , both being equally suggested by the immediate	1700
own nature a fitness to be suggested by them , before ever they had been experienced to coexist with them . From which prejudice everyone , perhaps , will not find it easy to emancipate himself , by any [ but ] the clearest convictions of reason . And there are some grounds to think that if there was one only invariable and universal languages in the world , and that men were born with the faculty of speaking it , it would be the opinion of many that the ideas of other men 's minds were properly perceived by the ear , or had at least a necessary and inseparable tie with the sounds that were affixed to them . All which seems to arise from want of a due application of our	1700
, perhaps , hardly be discovered till such time as the manner of vision is more perfectly made known . Concerning which , I must own , I have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least show of PROBABILITY , not to mention CERTAINTY . I shall , therefore , leave this knot to be untied by you , wishing you may have better success in it than I have had . ' 30 . The ancient and received principle , which Dr. Barrow here mentions as the main foundation of Tacquet 's CATOPTRICS , is that : 'every visible point seen by reflection from a speculum shall appear placed at the intersection of the reflected ray , and the perpendicular of incidence : ' which intersection in the present	1700
and mediate objects of sight , and are so prone to attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter . They are , as it were , most closely twisted , blended , and incorporated together . And the prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long tract of time , by the use of language , and want of reflexion . However , I believe anyone that shall attentively consider what we have already said , and shall say , upon this subject before we have done ( especially if he pursue it in his own	1700
discriminate between the immediate and mediate objects of sight , and are so prone to attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter . They are , as it were , most closely twisted , blended , and incorporated together . And the prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long tract of time , by the use of language , and want of reflexion .

, by means of which they appear far larger than others , whose visible appearance hath an equal or even greater extension ; it follows that upon the change or omission of any of those circumstances which are wont to attend the vision of distant objects , and so come to influence the judgments made on their magnitude , they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would . For any of those things that caused an object to be thought greater than in proportion to its visible extension being either omitted or applied without the usual circumstances , the judgment depends more entirely on the visible extension , and consequently the object must be judged less . Thus in the present case	1700
all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance , doth it in the same way that words suggest the notions to which they are annexed . Now , it is known a word pronounced with certain circumstances , or in a certain context with other words , hath not always the same import and signification that it hath when pronounced in some other circumstances or different context of words . The very same visible appearance as to faintness and all other respects , if placed on high , shall not suggest the same magnitude that it would if it were seen at an equal distance on a level with the eye . The reason whereof is that we are rarely accustomed to view objects at a great height ; our concerns lie among things situated rather before than above us , and accordingly	1700
straining of the eye 28 The occasions which suggest distance have in their own nature no relation to it 29 A difficult case proposed by Dr. Barrow as repugnant to all the known theories 30 This case contradicts a received principle in catoptrics 31 It is shown to agree with the principles we have laid down 32 This phenomenon illustrated 33 It confirms the truth of the principle whereby it is explained 34 Vision when distinct , and when confused 35 The different effects of parallel diverging and converging rays 36 How converging and diverging rays come to suggest the same distance 37 A person extreme purblind would judge aright in the	1700
has in them scarce anything occurred to my observation different from what has been already said by Kepler , Scheinerus , Descartes , and others . And methinks , I had better say nothing at all , than repeat that which has been so often said by others . I think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject : but before I quit it for good and all , the fair and ingenuous dealing that I owe both to you and to truth obligeth me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty , which seems directly opposite to the doctrine I have been hitherto inculcating , at least , admits of no solution from it . In short it is this . Before the double convex glass or concave speculum EBF , let the point A be placed at such	1700
they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would . For any of those things that caused an object to be thought greater than in proportion to its visible extension being either omitted or applied without the usual circumstances , the judgment depends more entirely on the visible extension , and consequently the object must be judged less . Thus in the present case the situation of the thing seen being different from what it usually is in those objects we have occasion to view , and whose magnitude we observe , it follows that the very same object , being an hundred feet high , should seem less than if it was an hundred feet off on ( or nearly on ) a level with the eye . What has been here set forth seems to me to have no small share in contributing to	1700
used to apply the terms UP and DOWN , HIGH and LOW , were such only as affected or were some way perceived by his couch : but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas , perfectly distinct and different from the former , and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch . There is , therefore , nothing at all that could induce him to think those terms applicable to them : nor would he ever think it till such time as he had observed their connexion with tangible objects , and the same prejudice began to insinuate itself into his understanding , which from their infancy had grown up in the understandings of other men . 96 . To set this matter in a clearer light I shall make	1700
common to both senses . 2 . It is , I think , agreed by all that DISTANCE , of itself and immediately , can not be seen . For DISTANCE being a Line directed end-wise to the eye , it projects only one point in the fund of the eye , which point remains invariably the same , whether the distance be longer or shorter . 3 . I find it also acknowledged that the estimate we make of the distance of OBJECTS considerably remote is rather an act of judgment grounded on EXPERIENCE than of SENSE . For example , when I perceive a great number of intermediate OBJECTS , such as houses , fields , rivers , and	1700
since that remains the same , or is rather lesser , by how much the moon is nearer to the horizon . It remains therefore that the true cause is that affection or alteration of the visible appearance which proceeds from the greater paucity of rays arriving at the eye , and which I term FAINTNESS : since this answers all the forementioned conditions , and I am not conscious of any other perception that doth . 71 . Add to this that in misty weather it is a common observation that the appearance of the horizontal moon is far larger than usual , which greatly conspires with and strengthens our opinion . Neither would it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have said , if the	1700
the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eyes and greater or lesser distance , but because the mind has by constant EXPERIENCE found the different sensations corresponding to the different dispositions of the eyes to be attended each with a different degree of distance in the OBJECT : there has grown an habitual or customary connection between those two sorts of IDEAS , so that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes , In order to bring the PUPILS nearer or farther asunder , but it withal perceives the different IDEA of distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation ; just as upon hearing a certain sound , the IDEA is immediately suggested to the understanding which custom had united with it . 18 Nor do I see how I can easily be	1700
an idea by itself , or any combination of ideas to which it gives one name , and so makes it pass for an unit . According as the mind variously combines its ideas the unit varies : and as the unit , so the number , which is only a collection of units , doth also vary . We call a window one , a chimney one , and yet a house in which there are many windows and many chimneys hath an equal right to be called one , and many houses go to the making of the city . In these and the like , instances it is evident the unit constantly relates to the particular draughts the mind makes of its ideas ,	1700
several ideas of sight and touch , he will be able , by the perception he has of the situation of visible things in respect of one another , to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of outward , tangible things corresponding to them . And thus it is he shall perceive by sight the situation of external objects which do not properly fall under that sense . 100 . I know we are very prone to think that , if just made to see , we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now : but we are also as prone to think that , at	1700
what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a distance , will agree with me that what he sees only suggests to his understanding that after having passed a certain distance , to be measured by the motion of his body , which is perceivable by touch , he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas . But that one might be deceived by these suggestions of sense , and that there is no necessary connexion between visible and tangible ideas suggested by them , we need go no farther than the next looking-glass or pictures to be convinced . Note that when I speak of tangible ideas , I take the word idea for any	1700
to it . 97 . Afterwards , when upon turning his head or eyes up and down to the right and left he shall observe the visible objects to change , and shall also attain to know that they are called by the same names , and connected with the objects perceived by touch ; then indeed he will come to speak of them and their situation , in the same terms that he has been used to apply to tangible things ; and those that he perceives by turning up his eyes he will call upper , and those that by turning down his eyes he will call lower .	1700
and the ways whereby they enter into the understanding , that something more is perceived by sight than barely light and colours with their variations . Mr. Locke termeth sight , 'The most comprehensive of all our senses , conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colours , which are peculiar only to that sense ; and also the far different ideas of space , figure , and motion .

And as for figure and extension , I leave it to anyone that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he had any idea intromitted immediately and properly by sight save only light and colours : or whether it De possible for him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension or figure exclusive of all colour : and on the other hand , whether he can conceive colour without visible extension ? For my own part , I must confess I am not able to attain so great a	1700
or were some way perceived by his couch : but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas , perfectly distinct and different from the former , and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch . There is , therefore , nothing at all that could induce him to think those terms applicable to them : nor would he ever think it till such time as he had observed their connexion with tangible objects , and the same prejudice began to insinuate itself into his understanding , which from their infancy had grown up in the understandings of other men . 96 . To set this matter in a clearer light I shall make use of an example . Suppose the above-mentioned blind person by	1700
to be observed that what we immediately and properly see are only lights and colours in sundry situations and shades and degrees of faintness and clearness , confusion and distinctness . All which visible objects are only in the mind , nor do they suggest ought external , whether distance or magnitude , otherwise than by habitual connexion as words do things . We are also to remark that , beside the straining of the eyes , and beside the vivid and faint , the distinct and confused appearances ( which , bearing some proportion to lines and angles , have been substituted instead of them in the foregoing part of this treatise ) , there are other means which suggest both distance and magnitude ; particularly the situation of visible points of objects , as upper	1700
proceed to make some observations concerning matters relating thereto , whereof the want of reflexion , and duly separating between tangible and visible ideas , is apt to create in us mistaken and confused notions . And FIRST , I shall observe that the MINIMUM VISIBILE is exactly equal in all beings whatsoever that are endowed with the visive faculty . No exquisite formation of the eye , no peculiar sharpness of sight , can make it less in one creature than in another ; for it not being distinguishable into parts , nor in any wise a consisting of them , it must necessarily be the same to all . For suppose it otherwise , and that the MINIMUM VISIBILE of a mite , for instance , be less than the MINIMUM VISIBILE of a man : the latter therefore may by detraction	1700
forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are , by the wonted ordinary course of Nature like to follow . Looking at an object I perceive a certain visible figure and colour , with some degree of faintness and other circumstances , which from what I have formerly observed , determine me to think that if I advance forward so many paces or miles , I shall be affected with such and such ideas of touch : so that in truth and strictness of speech I neither see distance itself , nor anything that I take to be at a distance . I say , neither distance nor things placed at a distance are themselves , or their ideas , truly perceived by sight . This I am persuaded of , as to what concerns	1700
due distance . A microscope brings us , as it were , into a new world : it presents us with a new scene of visible objects quite different from what we behold with the naked eye . But herein consists the most remarkable difference , to wit , that whereas the objects perceived by the eye alone have a certain connexion with tangible objects , whereby we are taught to foresee what will ensue upon the approach or application of distant objects to the parts of our own body , which much conduceth to its preservation , there is not the like connexion between things tangible and those visible objects that are perceived by help of a fine microscope . 86 . Hence it is evident that	1700
That a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle 142 ANS . That a visible square is fitter than a visible circle , to represent a tangible square 143 But it doth not hence follow , that a visible square is like a tangible square 144 Why we are more apt to confound visible with tangible IDEAS , than other signs with the things signified 145 Several other reasons hereof , assigned 146 Reluctancy in rejecting any opinion , no argument of its truth 147 Proper objects of vision the language of nature 148 In it there is much admirable , and deserving our attention 149 Question proposed , concerning the object of geometry 150 At first view we are apt to think visible extension the object of geometry 151 Visible extension shown not to be the	1700
, and their surfaces , and lines generated by their section 155 Nor even the elements of plane geometry 156 The proper objects of sight incapable of being managed as geometrical figures 157 The opinion of those who hold plane figures to be the immediate objects of sight , considered 158 Planes no more the immediate objects of sight , than solids 159 Difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the above-mentioned intelligence 160 The object of geometry , its not being sufficiently understood , cause of difficulty , and useless labour in that science AN ESSAY TOWARDS A NEW THEORY OF VISION 1 . My design is to show the manner wherein we perceive by	1700
mediation of light and colours other far different ideas are suggested to my mind : but so they are by hearing , which beside sounds which are peculiar to that sense , doth by their mediation suggest not only space , figure , and motion , but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signified by words . 131 . THIRDLY , it is , I think , an axiom universally received that quantities of the same kind may be added together and make one entire sum . Mathematicians add lines together : but they do not add a line to a solid , or conceive it as making one sum with a surface : these three kinds of quantity being thought incapable of any such mutual addition , and consequently of being compared together in the several ways	1700
that brutes and children , or even grown reasonable men , whenever they perceive an OBJECT to approach , or depart from them , do it by virtue of GEOMETRY and DEMONSTRATION . 25 . That one IDEA may suggest another to the mind it will suffice that they have been observed to go together , without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence , or without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist . Of this there are innumerable instances of which no one can be ignorant . 26 . Thus , greater confusion	1700
vary . We call a window one , a chimney one , and yet a house in which there are many windows and many chimneys hath an equal right to be called one , and many houses go to the making of the city . In these and the like , instances it is evident the unit constantly relates to the particular draughts the mind makes of its ideas , to which it affixes names , and wherein it includes more or less as best suits its own ends and purposes . Whatever , therefore , the mind considers as one , that is an unit . Every combination of ideas is considered as one thing by the mind , and in token thereof is marked by one name . Now , this naming and combining together of ideas is perfectly arbitrary , and done by	1700
, the received notions and settled opinion of mankind , I shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the following arguments . 128 . When upon perception of an idea I range it under this or that sort , it is because it is perceived after the same manner , or because it has a likeness or conformity with , or affects me in the same way as , the ideas of the sort I rank it under . In short , it must not be entirely new , but have something in it old and already perceived by me . It must , I say , have so much at least in common with the ideas I have before known	1700
have employed their thoughts on that subject ; but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavours have been is sufficiently shown in THE TRANSACTIONS , [ Phil . Trans . Num . 187. p. 314 ] where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confuted , not without some surprize at the gross blunders that ingenious men have been forced into by endeavouring to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary Principles of optics . Since the writing of which there hath been published in the TRANSACTIONS [ Numb . 187 . P. 323 ] another paper relating to the same affair by the celebrated Dr. Wallis ,	1700
purposes it may be subservient to : only , I can not forbear making some inquiry concerning the object of geometry , which the subject we have been upon doth naturally lead one to . We have shown there is no such idea as that of extension in abstract , and that there are two kinds of sensible extension and figures which are entirely distinct and heterogeneous from each other . Now , it is natural to inquire which of these is the object of geometry . 150 . Some things there are which at first sight incline one to	1700
signification would never be applied to anything that was not conceived to exist without the mind . For a man born blind , and remaining in the same state , could mean nothing else by the words HIGHER and LOWER than a greater or lesser distance from the earth ; which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his hand or some other part of his body . It is therefore evident that all those things which , in respect of each other , would by him be thought higher or lower , must be such as were conceived to exist without his mind , in the ambient space . 95 . Whence it plainly follows that such a one , if we suppose him made to see , would not at first sight think anything	1700
is great , or small , of this or that determinate measure , I say it must be meant of the tangible , and not the visible extension , which , though immediately perceived , is nevertheless little taken notice of . 62 . Now , that there is no necessary connexion between these two distinct extensions is evident from hence : because our eyes might have been framed in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what were less than the MINIMUM TANGIBILE . In which case it is not impossible we might have perceived all the immediate objects of sight	1700
exist ; an idea , wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together ' ESSAY ON HUM . UNDERSTAND . B. iv . C. 7 . S.9 . This is the idea which he thinks needful for the enlargement of knowledge , which is the subject of mathematical demonstration , and without which we could never come to know any general proposition concerning triangles . That author acknowledges it doth 'require some pains and skill to form this general idea of a triangle . ' IBID . But had he called to mind what he says in another place , to wit , 'That ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent ideas are put together can not so much as exist in the mind , i.e	1700
distinct names annexed to them . Thus one combination of a certain tangible figure , bulk , and consistency of parts is called the head , another the hand , a third the foot , and so of the rest : all which complex ideas could , in his understanding , be made up only of ideas perceivable by touch . He had also by his touch obtained an idea of earth or ground , towards which he perceives the parts of his body to have a natural tendency . Now , by ERECT nothing more being meant than that perpendicular position of a man wherein his feet are nearest to the earth ,	1700
: but we have shown that extension in abstract hath no finite determinate magnitude . Whence it clearly follows that it can have no figure , and consequently is not the object of geometry . It is indeed a tenet as well of the modern as of the ancient philosophers that all general truths are concerning universal abstract ideas ; without which , we are told , there could be no science , no demonstration of any general proposition in geometry . But it were no hard matter , did I think it necessary to my present purpose , to show that propositions and demonstrations in geometry might be universal , though they who make them never think of abstract general ideas of triangles or circles	1700
angles , and did not apprehend the true nature of vision , and how far it was of mathematical consideration . 40 . Before we dismiss this subject , it is fit we take notice of a query relating thereto , proposed by the ingenious Mr. Molyneux , is his TREATISE OF DIOPTRICS , [ Par . I . Prop . 31 , Sect . 9 . ] where speaking of this difficulty , he has these words : 'And so he ( i.e . Dr. Barrow ) leaves this difficulty to the solution of others , which I ( after so great an example ) shall do likewise ; but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quitting the evident doarine which we have before laid down , for determining the LOCUS OBJECTI , on account of being	1700
the mind , perceiving an impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye , considers this ray as coming in a direct line from the lower part of the object ; and in like manner tracing the ray that strikes on the lower part of the eye , it is directed to the upper part of the object . Thus in the adjacent figure , C , the lower point of the object ABC , is projected on C the upper part of the eye . So likewise the highest point A is projected on A the lowest part of the eye , which makes the representation CBA inverted : but the mind considering the stroke that is made on C as coming in the straight line	1700
against the proposition we have shown to be true . For where there is so much prejudice to be encountered , a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice . We must also satisfy the scruples that men may raise in favour of their preconceived notions , show whence the mistake arises , how it came to spread , and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implanted in the mind . 139 . FIRST , therefore , it will be demanded how visible extension and figures come to be called	1700
scarce forbear thinking them equally the immediate object of vision . 146 . The prejudice which is grounded on these , and whatever other causes may be assigned thereof , sticks so fast that it is impossible without obstinate striving and labour of the mind to get entirely clear of it . But then the reluctancy we find in rejecting any opinion can be no argument of its truth to whoever considers what has been already shown with regard to the prejudices we entertain concerning the distance , magnitude , and situation of objects ; prejudices so familiar to our minds	1700
? Whereas it is evident the tangible earth is not perceived by sight : and it hath been shown in the two last preceding sections that the location of visible objects is determined only by the distance they bear from one another ; and that it is nonsense to talk of distance , far or near , between a visible and tangible thing . 114 . If we confine our thoughts to the proper objects of sight , the whole is plain and easy . The head is painted farthest from , and the feet nearest to , the visible earth ; and so they appear to be . What is there strange or unaccountable in this ? Let us suppose the pictures in the fund of the eye to be the immediate objects of	1700
birth have grown up in a continued habit of seeing are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other side , to wit , in thinking what they see to be at a distance from them . For at this time it seems agreed on all hands , by those who have had any thoughts of that matter , that colours , which are the proper and immediate object of sight , are not without the mind . But then it will be said , by sight we have also the ideas of extension , and figure , and motion ; all which may well be thought without , and at some distance from the mind , though colour should not . In answer to this I appeal to any man 's experience , whether the visible extension of any object doth not appear as near to him as the	1700
, because the combination of visible ideas hath constantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it is connected : which doth of necessity arise from the use and end of language . 50 . In order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision , we must bear in mind that there are two sorts of objects apprehended by the eye , the one primarily and immediately , the other secondarily and by intervention of the former . Those of the first sort neither are , nor appear to be , without the mind , or at any distance off ; they may indeed grow greater or smaller , more confused , or more clear , or more faint , but they do not , can not approach or recede from us . Whenever we	1700
, and then judge whether they are agreeable to truth and his own experience , or no . 121 . We have shown the way wherein the mind by mediation of visible ideas doth perceive or apprehend the distance , magnitude and situation of tangible objects . We come now to inquire more particularly concerning the difference between the ideas of sight and touch , which are called by the same names , and see whether there be any idea common to both senses . From what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing parts of this treatise , it is plain there is no one selfsame numerical extension perceived both by sight and touch ; but that the particular figures and extensions perceived by sight , however they may be called by	1700
some invariable , determinate extension fixed on to be marked to the word inch , it is plain it can be used to little purpose ; and to say a thing contains this or that number of inches shall imply no more than that it is extended , without bringing any particular idea of that extension into the mind . Farther , an inch and a foot , from different distances , shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude , and yet at the same time you shall say that one seems several times greater than the other . From all which it is manifest that the judgments we make of the magnitude of objects by sight are altogether in reference to their tangible extension . Whenever we say an object is great , or small , of this or that determinate measure ,	1700
learned men to account for this appearance . Gassendus , Descartes , Hobbes , and several others have employed their thoughts on that subject ; but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavours have been is sufficiently shown in THE TRANSACTIONS , [ Phil . Trans . Num . 187. p. 314 ] where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confuted , not without some surprize at the gross blunders that ingenious men have been forced into by endeavouring to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary Principles of optics . Since the writing of which there hath been published in the TRANSACTIONS [ Numb . 187 . P. 323 ] another paper relating to the same affair	1700
, and whether there be any IDEA common to both senses . 2 . It is , I think , agreed by all that DISTANCE , of itself and immediately , can not be seen . For DISTANCE being a Line directed end-wise to the eye , it projects only one point in the fund of the eye , which point remains invariably the same , whether the distance be longer or shorter . 3 . I find it also acknowledged that the estimate we make of the distance of OBJECTS considerably remote is rather an act of judgment grounded on EXPERIENCE than of SENSE . For example , when I perceive a	1700
what hath been said concerning the manner wherein that sense doth suggest their various distances , magnitudes , and situations , I shall not enlarge any farther on this subject , but proceed to consider what may be alleged , with greatest appearance of reason , against the proposition we have shown to be true . For where there is so much prejudice to be encountered , a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice . We must also satisfy the scruples that men may raise in favour of their preconceived notions , show whence the mistake arises , how it came to spread , and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implanted in the mind . 139 .	1700
to the former : it doth therefore consist of parts , which is inconsistent with the notion of a MINIMUM VISIBILE or point . 81 . It will perhaps be objected that the MINIMUM VISIBILE of a man doth really and in itself contain parts whereby it surpasses that of a mite , though they are not perceivable by the man . To which I answer , the MINIMUM VISIBILE having ( in like manner as all other the proper and immediate objects of sight ) been shown not to have any existence without the mind of him who sees it , it follows there can not be any pan of it that is not actually	1700
Sure I am it is worth some attention , to whoever would understand the true nature of vision . 52 . I have now done with distance , and proceed to show how it is that we perceive by sight the magnitude of objects . It is the opinion of some that we do it by angles , or by angles in conjunction with distance : but neither angles nor distance being perceivable by sight , and the things we see being in truth at no distance from us , it follows that as we have shown lines and angles not to be the	1700
tangible things corresponding to them . And thus it is he shall perceive by sight the situation of external objects which do not properly fall under that sense . 100 . I know we are very prone to think that , if just made to see , we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now : but we are also as prone to think that , at first sight , we should in the same way apprehend the distance and magnitude of objects as we do now : which hath been shown to be a false and groundless persuasion . And for the like reasons the same censure may be passed on the positive assurance that most men , before they have thought sufficiently of the matter	1700
follows that no visible magnitude having in its own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude , so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connected with its corresponding tangible figure : so as of itself and in a way prior to experience , it might suggest it to the understanding . This will be farther evident if we consider that what seems smooth and round to the touch may to sight , if viewed through a microscope , seem quite otherwise . 106 . From all which laid together and duly considered , we may clearly deduce this inference . In the first act of vision no idea entering by the eye would have a perceivable connexion with the ideas to which the names EARTH , MAN , HEAD	1700
is built on this supposition ( VID . COROL . I . PROP . 57 , IBID . ) comes to the ground along with it . 41 . From what hath been premised it is a manifest consequence that a man born blind , being made to see , would , at first , have no idea of distance by sight ; the sun and stars , the remotest objects as well as the nearer , would all seem to be in his eye , or rather in his mind . The objects intromitted by sight would seem to him ( as in truth they are ) no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations , each whereof is as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure , or the most inward passions	1700
mile 's end , that which I saw first is quite lost , neither do I find anything in the likeness of it . 45 . In these and the like instances the truth of the matter stands thus : having of a long time experienced certain ideas , perceivable by touch , as distance , tangible figure , and solidity , to have been connected with certain ideas of sight , I do upon perceiving these ideas of sight forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are , by the wonted ordinary course of Nature like to follow . Looking at an object I perceive a certain visible figure and colour , with some degree of faintness and other circumstances , which from what I have formerly observed , determine me to think that if I advance	1700
into the matter we shall find that those things only are compared together in respect of distance which exist after the same manner , or appertain unto the same sense . For by the distance between any two points nothing more is meant than the number of intermediate points : if the given points are visible the distance between them is marked out by the number of the interjacent visible points : if they are tangible , the distance between them is a line consisting of tangible points ; but if they are one tangible and the other visible , the distance between them doth neither consist of points perceivable by sight nor by touch , i.e .	1700
. It is every whit as great when our view is contracted and bounded by near objects as when it is extended to larger and remoter . For it being impossible that one MINIMUM VISIBILE should obscure or keep out of sight mote than one other , it is a plain consequence that when my view is on all sides bounded by the walls of my study see just as many visible points as I could , in case that by the removal of the study-walls and all other obstructions , I had a full prospect of the circumjacent fields , mountains , sea , and open firmament : for so long as I am shut up within the walls ,	1700
and figures , if they are not of the same kind with them ? It must be something more than humour or accident that could occasion a custom so constant and universal as this , which has obtained in all ages and nations of the world , and amongst all ranks of men , the learned as well as the illiterate . 140 . To which I answer , we can no more argue a visible and tangible square to be of the same species from their being called by the same name , than we can that a tangible square and the monosyllable consisting of six letters whereby it is marked are of the same species because they are	1700
see what ideas do , and what do not include or imply this or that other idea . 67 . There is a celebrated phenomenon , the solution whereof I shall attempt to give by the principles that have been laid down , in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of objects . The apparent magnitude of the moon when placed in the horizon is much greater than when it is in the meridian , though the angle under which the diameter of the moon is seen be not observed greater in the former case than in the latter : and the horizontal moon doth not constantly appear of the same	1700
other parts of that science ( which being rather physical , do consequently abound with plausible conjectures instead of certain principles ) , there has in them scarce anything occurred to my observation different from what has been already said by Kepler , Scheinerus , Descartes , and others . And methinks , I had better say nothing at all , than repeat that which has been so often said by others . I think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject : but before I quit it for good and all , the fair and ingenuous dealing that I owe both to you and to truth obligeth me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty , which seems directly opposite to the doctrine	1700
Our propension to think the contrary , no argument against what has been said 101 Objection 102 Answer 103 An object could not be known at first sight by the colour 104 Nor by the magnitude thereof 105 Nor by the figure 106 In the first act of vision , no tangible thing would be suggested by sight 107 Difficulty proposed concerning number 108 Number of things visible , would not at first sight suggest the like number of things tangible 109 Number the creature of the mind 110 One born blind would not at first sight number visible things as others do 111 The situation of any object determined with respect only to objects of the same sense 112 No distance , great or small , between a visible and tangible thing 113 The not observing this , cause of difficulty in erect vision 114 Which otherwise includes	1700
the picture of the head is farthest from the picture of the earth , and the picture of the feet nearest to the picture of the earth ; and accordingly the visible head is farthest from the visible earth , and the visible feet nearest to it . It remains , therefore , that you mean the tangible earth , and so determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible things ; contrary to what hath been demonstrated in sect . 111 and 112 . The two distinct provinces of sight and touch should be considered apart , and as if their objects had no intercourse	1700
eye . If therefore Mr. Molyneux 's conjecture held good , it would follow that the eye should see the object twice as far off as it really is ; and in other cases at three or four times its due distance , or more . But this manifestly contradicts experience , the object never appearing , at farthest , beyond its due distance . Whatever , therefore , is built on this supposition ( VID . COROL . I . PROP . 57 , IBID . ) comes to the ground along with it . 41 . From what hath been premised it is a manifest consequence that a	1700
, the respective tangible magnitudes of those parts . 105 . By the foregoing section it is plain the visible figure of any part of the body hath no necessary connexion with the tangible figure thereof , so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind . For figure is the termination of magnitude ; whence it follows that no visible magnitude having in its own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude , so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connected with its corresponding tangible figure : so as of itself and in a way	1700
great an example ) shall do likewise ; but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quitting the evident doarine which we have before laid down , for determining the LOCUS OBJECTI , on account of being pressed by one difficulty which seems inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtained by mortals . In the meantime , I propose it to the consideration of the ingenious , whether the LOCUS APPARENS of an object placed as in this 9th section be not as much before the eye as the distinct base is behind the eye ! ' To which query we	1700
is not only narrow , but also for the most part confused : of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly : and the more we fix our sight on any one object , by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear . 84 . Corresponding to these two defects of sight , we may imagine as many perfections , to wit , 1ST , that of comprehending in one view a greater number of visible points . 2DLY , of being able to view them all	1700
the rays of light , and thereby render the appearance less strong and vivid : now , faintness of appearance caused in this sort hath been experienced to coexist with great magnitude . But when it is caused by the interposition of an opaque sensible body , this circumstance alters the case , so that a faint appearance this way caused doth not suggest greater magnitude , because it hath not been experienced to coexist with it . 73 . Faintness , as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance , doth it in the same way that words suggest the notions to which they are annexed . Now , it is known a word pronounced with certain circumstances , or in a certain context with other words , hath not always the	1700
in themselves are not capable of affecting or any wise altering the frame of their bodies ) they may be able to foresee ( from the experience they have had what tangible ideas are connected with such and such visible ideas ) and damage or benefit which is like to ensue , upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance . Which foresight , how necessary it is to the preservation of an animal , everyone 's experience can inform him . Hence it is that when we look at an object , the tangible figure and	1700
, it is clear that neither abstract nor visible extension makes the object of geometry ; the not discerning of which may perhaps have created some difficulty and useless labour in mathematics . Sure I am , that somewhat relating thereto has occurred to my thoughts , which , though after the most anxious and repeated examination I am forced to think it true , doth , nevertheless , seem so far out of the common road of geometry , that I know not whether it may not be thought presumption , if I should make it public in an age , wherein that science hath received such mighty improvements by new methods ; great part whereof , as well as of the ancient discoveries , may perhaps lose their reputation , and much of that ardour with which men study the abstruse	1700
, is not perceived immediately by vision : for it appeareth to the eye various and multiform . 158 . From all which we may conclude that planes are no more the immediate object of sight than solids . What we strictly see are not solids , nor yet planes variously coloured : they are only diversity of colours . And some of these suggest to the mind solids , and other plane figures , just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or the other : so that we see planes in the same way that we see solids , both being equally suggested by the immediate objects of sight , which accordingly are themselves denominated planes and solids . But though they are called by the same names with the things marked by	1700
extraordinary largeness attributed by the mind to the horizontal moon at a time when the angle subtended by its diameter is not one jot greater than it used to be . 77 . With reference to this opinion , not to repeat what hath been already said concerning distance , I shall only observe , FIRST , that if the prospect of interjacent objects be that which suggests the idea of farther distance , and this idea of farther distance be the cause that brings into the mind the idea of greater magnitude , it should hence follow that if one looked at the horizontal moon from behind a wall , it would appear no bigger than ordinary . For in that case the wall interposing cuts off all that prospect of sea and land , etc . which might otherwise	1700
, in case that by the removal of the study-walls and all other obstructions , I had a full prospect of the circumjacent fields , mountains , sea , and open firmament : for so long as I am shut up within the walls , by their interposition every point of the external objects is covered from my view : but each point that is seen being able to cover or exclude from sight one only other corresponding point , it follows that whilst my sight is confined to those narrow walls I see as many points , or MINIMA VISIBILIA , as	1700
general idea of a triangle . ' IBID . But had he called to mind what he says in another place , to wit , 'That ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent ideas are put together can not so much as exist in the mind , i.e . be conceived . ' VID . B. iii . C. 10 . S. 33 . IBID . I say , had this occurred to his thoughts , it is not improbable he would have owned it above all the pains and skill he was master of to form the above-mentioned idea of a triangle , which is made up of manifest , staring contradictions . That a man who laid so great a stress on clear and determinate ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seems very surprising . But the wonder	1700
name . He would not , for example , make into one complex idea , and thereby esteem an unit , all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot . For there can be no reason assigned why he should do so , barely upon his seeing a man stand upright before him . There crowd into his mind the ideas which compose the visible man , in company with all the other ideas of sight perceived at the same time : but all these ideas offered at once to his view , he would not distribute into sundry distinct combinations till such time as by observing the motion of the parts of the man and other experiences he comes to know which are	1700
one corresponding point on the retina , but take up some space thereon , so that rays from different points become mixed and confused together . This is opposed to a distinct vision , and attends near objects . Faint vision is when by reason of the distance of the object or grossness of the interjacent medium few rays arrive from the object to the eye . This is opposed to vigorous or clear vision , and attends remote objects . But to return . 36 . The eye , or ( to speak truly ) the mind , perceiving only the confusion itself , without ever considering the cause from which it proceeds , doth constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of confusion . Whether that confusion be occasioned by converging or by diverging rays , it matters not . Whence it follows that	1700
by means of some other IDEA that is itself immediately perceived in the act of VISION . 12 . But those LINES and ANGLES , by means whereof some MATHEMATICIANS pretend to explain the perception of distance , are themselves not at all perceived , nor are they in truth ever thought of by those unskilful in optics . I appeal to anyone 's experience whether upon sight of an OBJECT he computes its distance by the bigness of the ANGLE made by the meeting of the two OPTIC AXES ? Or whether he ever thinks of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays , which arrive	1700
extent , were a subject too comprehensive to be insisted on in this place . And so much for extension in abstract . 126 . Some , perhaps , may think pure space , VACUUM , or trine dimension to be equally the object of sight and touch : but though we have a very great propension to think the ideas of outness and space to be the immediate object of sight , yet , if I mistake not , in the foregoing parts of this essay that hath been clearly demonstrated to be a mere delusion , arising from the quick and sudden suggestion of fancy , which so closely connects the idea of distance with those of sight , that	1700
till reason corrects the mistake . 127 . It having been shown that there are no abstract ideas of figure , and that it is impossible for us by any precision of thought to frame an idea of extension separate from all other visible and tangible qualities which shall be common both to sight and touch : the question now remaining is , whether the particular extensions , figures , and motions perceived by sight be of the same kind with the particular extensions , figures , and motions perceived by touch ? In answer to which I shall venture to lay down the following proposition : THE EXTENSION , FIGURES , AND MOTIONS PERCEIVED BY SIGHT ARE SPECIFICALLY DISTINCT FROM THE IDEAS OF TOUCH CALLED BY THE SAME NAMES , NOR is THERE ANY SUCH THING as ONE IDEA OR KIND OF IDEA COMMON TO	1700
apart from each other ; which would preserve us from confounding those that are different , and make us see what ideas do , and what do not include or imply this or that other idea . 67 . There is a celebrated phenomenon , the solution whereof I shall attempt to give by the principles that have been laid down , in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of objects . The apparent magnitude of the moon when placed in the horizon is much greater than when it is in the meridian , though the angle under which the diameter of the moon is seen be not observed greater in the former case than in	1700
. Of this there are innumerable instances of which no one can be ignorant . 26 . Thus , greater confusion having been constantly attended with nearer distance , no sooner is the former IDEA perceived , but it suggests the latter to our thoughts . And if it had been the ordinary course of Nature that the farther off an OBJECT were placed , the more confused it should appear , it is certain the very same perception that now makes us think an OBJECT approaches would then have made us to imagine it went farther off . That perception , abstracting from CUSTOM and EXPERIENCE , being equally fitted to produce the IDEA of great distance , or small distance , or no distance at all .	1700
sight ideas far different and distinct from them hath that faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than I can pretend to . It must be owned that by the mediation of light and colours other far different ideas are suggested to my mind : but so they are by hearing , which beside sounds which are peculiar to that sense , doth by their mediation suggest not only space , figure , and motion , but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signified by words . 131 . THIRDLY , it is , I think , an axiom universally received that quantities of the same kind may be added together and make one entire sum . Mathematicians add lines together : but they do not add a line to	1700
and an acute angle and farther distance . It does not in the least depend upon experience , but may be evidently known by anyone before he had experienced it , that the nearer the concurrence of the OPTIC AXES , the greater the ANGLE , and the remoter their concurrence is , the lesser will be the ANGLE comprehended by them . 6 . There is another way mentioned by optic writers , whereby they will have us judge of those distances , in respect of which the breadth of the PUPIL hath any sensible bigness : And that is	1700
. It can take in at one view but a certain determinate number of MINIMA VISIBILIA , beyond which it can not extend its prospect . Secondly , our sight is defective in that its view is not only narrow , but also for the most part confused : of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly : and the more we fix our sight on any one object , by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear . 84 . Corresponding to these two defects of sight , we may imagine as many perfections , to wit , 1ST ,	1700
Molyneux , is his TREATISE OF DIOPTRICS , [ Par . I . Prop . 31 , Sect . 9 . ] where speaking of this difficulty , he has these words : 'And so he ( i.e . Dr. Barrow ) leaves this difficulty to the solution of others , which I ( after so great an example ) shall do likewise ; but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quitting the evident doarine which we have before laid down , for determining the LOCUS OBJECTI , on account of being pressed by one difficulty which seems inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtained by mortals . In the meantime , I propose it	1700
, after a _Banter_ of near a Page , he says [ 33 ] , `` But I forget I am so near my Adversary 's Conclusion , wherein he so _gravely_ advises me , that I _would be pleas 'd for once to write Controversy , and not Play-Books_ . '' Nor did I ever hear the Divines of the Church condemn the Doctor for his sarcastical Method of writing Controversy . On the contrary , I remember at the University , that he used to be applauded no less for his Wit than for his Learning . And to exalt his Character as a Wit , his _Conferences between a_ Romish _Priest , a Fanatick Chaplain , and a Divine of the Church of_ England , _ & c._ were spoken of as an excellent _Comedy_ , and especially for that Part	1730
Revolution , as far as choosing the most proper Topicks of Invective , and treating of them in the way of _Drollery_ , can do . VIII . It is well known , that Gravity , Preciseness , Solemnity , Sourness , formal Dress and Behaviour , Sobriety of Manners , keeping at a distance from the common Pastimes of the World , Aversion to Rites and Ceremonies in the publick Worship , and to Pictures , Images , and Musick in Churches ; mixing Religion in common Conversion , using long Graces , practising Family-Worship , part of which was praying _ex tempore_	1730
will only instance in the Reverend Dr. _Atterbury_ and Dr. _South_ ; who being as famous for _Drollery_ as for Zeal for Religion , and applauded for their _Wit_ no less than for their _Orthodoxy_ ; and particularly for imploying the former in behalf of the latter , seem of sufficient Weight to bear down all Attempts to stifle their Productions . What Considerations can make us amends for the Loss of such excellent _drolling Writings_ , which promote Religion as well as Mirth ? With what incomparable Mockery , Ridicule and Sarcasm does Dr. _Atterbury_ treat all the Low-Church Clergy that come in his way , together with the _Whig_ Ministry and Administration in his several _Convocational Tracts_ ? Dr. _Wake_ , our present Archbishop of _Canterbury_ , is represented by him as	1730
_Erasmus_ for having _abundantly_ RIDICUL 'D their _Reliques_ ; and himself puts _Ridicule_ in Practice against them , by representing their Doctrines and Practices as _ridiculously foolish_ , as _despicably childish_ , and _Matter of mere Scorn_ ; as _monstrous_ ; as _Spells_ , _juggling Tricks_ , _gross Cheats_ , _Impostures_ [ 76 ] , and _wretched Shifts_ ; and in fine , in representing by way of _Specimen_ , all their _Miracles_ as _Legends_ ; of which he says , _These and a thousand more such like unreasonable Lies , which a Child of common Sense would laugh at , are impos 'd upon and swallow 'd by the ignorant People , and make a_ VERY GREAT _Part of the Popish Religion._ And	1730
Phrases , which he had learned when he was in _Scotland_ , where he was forced to be present at religious Exercises of six or seven Hours a-day ; and had practis 'd among the _Huguenot_ Ministers in _France_ [ 98 ] , who reported him to have a _sanctify 'd Heart_ , and to _speak the very Language of_ Canaan . This _Ridicule_ he _cover'd_ with _Seriousness_ ; having at that time Occasion for those Ministers , who were then his great Instruments in reconciling the Nation to his _Restoration_ . When he had no farther Occasion for them , he was open in his _Ridicule_ , and would say , that [ 99 ] _Presbyterianism was not a Religion for a Gentleman_ . X . Would you , who are a Man of Sense	1730
no Restraints from the _Immorality_ or _Indecency_ of treating the Bishop in the way of Ridicule and with the utmost Contempt ; but , on the contrary , to be spurr 'd on by the _Excellency_ and _Propriety_ thereof to use it against him , even in the [ 100 ] _Pulpit_ , as Part of the religious Exercise on the _Lord's-day_ . XI . There is an universal Love and Practice of _Drollery_ and _Ridicule_ in all , even the most _serious_ Men , in the most _serious Places_ , and on the most _serious Occasions_ . Go into the Privy-Councils of Princes , into Senates , into Courts of Judicature , and into the Assemblies of the Kirk or Church ; and you will find that Wit , good Humour	1730

For example , in the `` Preface '' to the _Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered_ he boastfully enumerated all the works -- some twenty-nine -- which had repudiated his earlier _Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion_ . And in malicious fact he held up the publication of the _Scheme_ for almost a year that he might add a `` Postscript to the Preface '' in which he identified six more pieces hostile to the _Grounds and Reasons_ . [ 4 ] By May of and with no visible sign of fatigue he took on a new contender ; this time it was John Rogers , canon	1730
can not fail forming in Men that Humour and Vein of _Ridicule_ upon _Dissenters_ which runs thro ' that Work . In a word , High-Church has constantly been an Enemy to , and a Ridiculer of the _Seriousness_ of _Puritans_ and _Dissenters_ , whom they have ever charg 'd with _Hypocrisy_ for their _Seriousness_ . `` After [ 89 ] the Civil War had broke out in , and the King and Court had settled at _Oxford_ , one _Birkenhead_ , who had liv 'd in _Laud_ 's Family , and been made Fellow of _All Souls College_ by _Laud_ 's Means , was appointed to write a Weekly Paper under the Title of _Mercurius Aulicus_	1730

And he _confesses_ he _was not enough aware , that this Implicitness of Conduct is the great Engine of Popery , fram 'd for the Destruction of_ good Nature , _as well as_ good Sense .

For it will naturally fall heaviest , where the Constraint has been the severest . The greater the Weight is , the bitterer will be the Satire .

The burning Papists themselves are not always _serious_ with us : They treat the Church and its Defenders as _fanatical_ , and _laugh_ at them as _such_ , just as the Church does the Dissenters , and have their elaborate Works of _Drollery_ against their Adversaries . They publish 'd a Poem against the _Reformation_ , just before the Death of Queen _Anne_ , which was design 'd to have given such a Stroke to the Protestant Religion among us , under the new projected Revolution , as _Hudibras_ did to _Puritanism_ after the _Restoration_ .

His _Praise of Folly_ treats of _serious_ Matters , in such a gay , familiar , ingenious and pleasant manner , as makes it a Work proper to be read by intelligent People , to remove out of their Minds all Bigotry contracted by Ignorance and an evil Education , all Peevishness , Hatred , and Ill-nature towards one another , on account of different Sentiments in Religion ; and to form in them the natural Principles of Moderation , Humanity , Affection and Friendship .

I find also , that the _Puritans_ and _Dissenters_ have always born with , and allow 'd of , a great Mixture of _Drollery_ in their Sermons , that one would think should offend their Gravity , and pious Ears ; and that they applaud their Ministers for such their Discourses , as much as the Church does Dr. _South_ for the Ribaldry sprinkled thro'out his Sermons about the most high Points in Divinity . They have always had some eminent Divines among them who have been remarkable for such Passages and Reflections : And these have never lessen 'd their number of Auditors , nor drawn upon themselves the Character of _Irreligious_ ;	1730
on their making any Improvements ; he always oblig 'd his Family to a constant attendance on Publick Worship ; as he was himself a Man of the strictest Morality , for he never suffer 'd any Body about him who was deficient in that Point ; he exercised a universal Charity to all Sorts of People , without any Regard either to Sect or Party ; being in the Commission of the Peace , he administered Justice with such Impartiality and Incorruptness , that the most distant Part of the County flock 'd to his Decisions ; but the chief Use he made of his Authority was in accommodating Differences ; ... [ 1 ] In a comparison which likens him to Sir Roger de Coverley , there is less truth than fiction . What they did share was a love of the countryside and a	1730
self , and the Execution of it , with so much Learning , Sense , and Wit , raise in you the highest Esteem and Admiration of the Author , instead of a Disposition to punish him ? Would you appear to the intelligent Part of the World such an Enemy to Knowledge , and such a Friend to the Kingdom of Darkness , as such Punishment would imply ? In fine , can you see and direct us to a better way , to make us inquire after and understand Matters of Religion , to make us get and keep a good temper of Mind , and to plant and cultivate in us the Virtues necessary to good Order and Peace in Society , and to eradicate the Vices that every where give Society so much Disturbance	1730
and _universal Applause_ and _Encouragement_ for such _Ridicule_ and _Irony_ , and distinguishing by all the honourable ways imaginable such _drolling_ Authors for their Drollery ; and when Punishment for _Drollery_ is never call 'd for , but when _Drollery_ is used or employ 'd against them ! ( p. 29 ) Collins 's technique continued its ironic ambiguity , reversal , and obliquity . Under a tone of seeming innocence and good will , he credited his adversaries with an enviable capacity for satiric argument . In comradely fashion , he found precedent for his own rhetorical practice through a variety of historical and biblical analogies . But even more important for a contemporary audience , he again resorted to	1730
such Miracles deserve a serious Regard ? And shall the _Gravity_ with which Mankind is thus banter 'd out of their common Sense , excuse these Matters from _Ridicule_ ? It will be difficult to find any Writers who have exceeded the Doctors , _South_ and [ 40 ] _Edwards_ , in _Banter_ , _Irony_ , _Satire_ and _Sarcasms_ : The last of whom has written a Discourse in _Defence of sharp Reflections on Authors and their Opinions_ ; wherein he enumerates , as Examples for his Purpose , almost all the eminent Divines of the Church of _England_ . And Mr. [ 41 ] _Collier_ , speaking of a Letter of the Venerable _Bede_ to _Egbert_ Bishop of _York_ , says , `` The Satire and Declamation in this _Epistle_ shews the _pious Zeal_ and _Integrity_ of the Author ;	1730
he has been duped , that nowhere has there been a denial of Whiston 's charge that the reading of messianic prophecy in a typical or allegorical or secondary sense is `` weak and enthusiastical . '' On the contrary , the reader finds only the damning innuendo that the two methods -- the allegorical and the literal -- differ from one another not in kind but in degree of absurdity . After being protected for a long time by all the twists and turns of his creator 's irony , the persona finally reveals himself for what he is , a man totally insolent and totally without remorse . Never for one moment did he wish to defend the scheme of allegorical prophecy but to attack it . His argument , stripped of its convolutions	1730

And some _Virtuosi_ ( skill 'd in the _useful Philosophy_ of _Alterations_ ) have thought her much a Gainer by the latter Change , there being so many unlucky Turns in the World , in which it is not half so safe and advantageous to _walk upright_ , as to be _able to fall always upon one 's Legs_ . '' Again , Dr. _South_ says [ 123 ] , `` When I consider how wonderfully pleas 'd	1730

And I am not less pleasd to see them manage this controversy with ye same vile arts against one another , as they always use towards the laity .

But one of the justest and finest Pieces of _Irony_ , and the most timely and seasonably vented , and that deserves perpetual Remembrance , is , _Andrews_ the grave Bishop of _Winchester_ 's Irony , on _Neal_ the grave Bishop of _Durham_ ; of	1730

'' And this Jest has pass 'd much upon the World , and been continued down in many Books , where Mr. _Selden_ is mention 'd , to his Discredit with ignorant Readers , but not with the Knowing and Learned ; who , as Dr. _Wotton_ tells us [ 48 ] , _have , now Party-heats are over , acquiesced in what Mr._ Selden advanc 'd ; _who first_ , OF ALL CHRISTIANS , _set the Affair_ of Tythes _in a clear Light_ .

'' And this Pamphlet , which is also a continued Banter , begins thus . `` No Man has more deserv 'd than this good Bishop , and no Man has been more persecuted by various Ways and Means than his Lordship , even to mobbing !

The great and famous Sir _Thomas More_ , Lord Chancellor of _England_ in _Henry_ the Eighth 's time , was an inexhaustible Source of _Drollery_ [ 103 ] , as his voluminous Works , which consist for the most part of controversial Divinity in behalf of Popery , show , and which are many of them written in Dialogue , the better to introduce the _drolling_ Way of Writing , which he has us 'd in such Perfection , that it is said	1730

He was a brilliant and persistent trickster whose cunning in the techniques of polemic often silenced an opponent with every substantive right to win the debate . He seized any opportunity to expose the diversity of ethical and theological opinion which set one Anglican divine against another , `` to observe '' -- as Jenkin put it -- '' how the gladiators in dispute murder the cause between them , while they so fiercely cut and wound one another .

Christianity , therefore , not being really predicted in the Jewish Writings , is consequently false . `` [ 22 ] Collins continued his attack upon Christian revelation in the _Scheme_ .

It is said ( as I have before observ 'd ) of my Lord Chancellor _Clarendon_ , that `` he had too much _Levity_ in his _Wit_ [ 105 ] , and that he did not always observe the _Decorum_ of his Post .

The burning Papists themselves are not always _serious_ with us : They treat the Church and its Defenders as _fanatical_ , and _laugh_ at them as _such_ , just as the Church does the Dissenters , and have their elaborate Works of _Drollery_ against their Adversaries .

And accordingly he scruples not to say , in a most _drolling_ manner , that `` Transubstantiation is one of the chief of the _Roman_ Church 's _legerdemain_ and _juggling Tricks_ of Falshood and Imposture ; and that in all Probability those common juggling Words of _Hocus-pocus_ , are nothing else but a Corruption of _hoc est corpus_ , by way of ridiculous Imitation of the Church of _Rome_ in their _Trick_ of _Transubstantiation_ . '' And as he _archly_ makes the Introduction of this monstrous Piece of _grave Nonsense_ to be owing to its being at first preach 'd by its Promoters with _convenient Gravity and Solemnity_ [ 78 ] , which is the common Method of imposing Absurdities on the World	1730

'' Finally , here was one who , obedient to the spirit of God 's revealed word , rejected the fallacy that messianic prophecy had been fulfilled in Christ in any `` literal , obvious and primary sense . `` [ 21 ] But though the persona could not accept Whiston 's program , he was not a mere negativist . With growing excitement he argued for allegorical interpretation . At this point the reader discerns that he has been duped , that nowhere has	1730
corollary , that of man 's absolute right to religious enquiry and profession . Here he became specific , borrowing from Lockean empiricism his conditions of intellectual assent . `` Evidence , '' he said , `` ought to be the sole ground of Assent , and Examination is the way to arrive at Evidence ; and therefore rather than I wou 'd have Examination , Arguing and Objecting laid aside , I wou 'd chuse to say , That no Opinions whatever can be dangerous to a Man that impartially examines into the Truth of Things . `` [ 14 ] The	1730

And when they were attack 'd by one _Samuel Young_ , a whimsical Presbyterian-Buffoon-Divine , who call 'd himself _Trepidantium Malleus_ , and set up for an Imitator of Mr. _Alsop_ , in several Pamphlets full of Stories , Repartees , and Ironies	1730

made an Attack upon him : He heard them _gravely_ arguing for _Transubstantiation_ . He told them he was willing to receive Instruction ; he had taken much Pains to bring himself to believe in God , who made the World and all Men in it : But it must not be an ordinary Force of Argument that could make him believe that Man was quits with God , and made God again . The Earl of _Middleton_ had marry 'd into a Popish Family , and was a Man of great Parts and a generous Temper , but of loose Principles in Religion ; so a Priest was sent to instruct him . He began with _Transubstantiation_ , of which he said he would convince him immediately : And began thus , You believe the _Trinity_ . _Middleton_ stop 'd him ,	1730

Certainly he was more liberal than Rogers in his willingness to entertain professions of religious diversity . Yet he straitjacketed his liberalism when he denied responsible men the right to attack laws , both civil and canonical , with `` ludicrous Insult '' or `` with Buffoonery and Banter , Ridicule or Sarcastick Irony . `` [ 26 ] Once again Collins met the challenge . In _A Discourse concerning Ridicule and Irony_ he devoted himself to undermining the moral , the intellectual , and practical foundations of that one restraint which Marshall would impose upon the conduct of	1730

Anglican establishment came to the abrupt realization that the subject of the continuing debate -- the reliability of the argument from prophecy -- was inconclusive , that it could lead only to pedantic wrangling and hair-splitting with each side vainly clutching victory . Certainly the devotion of many clergymen to biblical criticism was secondary to their interest in orthodoxy as a functional adjunct of government , both civil and canonical . It was against this interest , as it was enunciated in Rogers 's _Eight Sermons concerning the Necessity of Revelation_ ( ) and particularly in its vindictive preface , that Collins chose to fight .

Why surely , Don Lorenzo , You can not be mad enough to think of making a Wife out of this Grand-daughter of ‘ as honest a painstaking Shoe-maker as any in Cordova ’ ? ” “ You forget , that She is also the Grand-daughter of the late Marquis de las Cisternas ; But without disputing about birth and titles , I must assure you , that I never beheld a Woman so interesting as Antonia. ” “ Very possibly ; But you can not mean to marry her ? ” “ Why not , my dear Condé ?

He endeavoured to reconcile me to my fate , and for some time treated me with respect and gentleness : At length finding that my aversion rather increased than diminished , He obtained those favours by violence , which I persisted	1790
your labour ; Bring your Offspring into the world yourself , Feed it yourself , Nurse it yourself , Bury it yourself : God grant that the latter may happen soon , lest you receive comfort from the fruit of your iniquity ! ” This inhuman speech , the threats which it contained , the dreadful sufferings foretold to me by the Domina , and her prayers for my Infant ’ s death , on whom though unborn I already doated , were more than my exhausted frame could support . Uttering a deep groan , I fell senseless at the feet of my unrelenting Enemy . I know not how long I remained in this situation ; But I imagine that some time must have elapsed before my recovery ,	1790
, not to hers , and assured her that in an hour She would be numbered with the Dead . Perceiving that it was vain to implore this unfeeling Woman , She attempted to spring from her bed , and call for assistance : She hoped , if She could not escape the fate announced to her , at least to have witnesses of the violence committed . The Prioress guessed her design . She seized her forcibly by the arm , and pushed her back upon her pillow . At the same time drawing a dagger , and placing it at the breast	1790
Once more my limbs were chained in second infancy . Once more I heard those fatal words repeated , ‘ Raymond ! Raymond ! Thou art mine ! Raymond ! Raymond ! I am thine ! & c.—— ’ The scene which had shocked me so sensibly on the former night , was again presented . The Spectre again pressed her lips to mine , again touched me with her rotting fingers , and as on her first appearance , quitted the chamber as soon as the Clock told “ Two. ” Even night was this repeated . Far from growing accustomed to the Ghost , every succeeding visit inspired me with greater horror . Her idea pursued me continually , and I became	1790
fraternal , circumstances have prevented us from being much together . While yet a Child She was consigned to the care of her Aunt , who had married a German Nobleman . At his Castle She remained till two years since , when She returned to Spain , determined upon secluding herself from the world. ” “ Good God ! Lorenzo , you knew of her intention , and yet strove not to make her change it ? ” “ Marquis , you wrong me . The intelligence , which I received at Naples , shocked me extremely , and I hastened my return to Madrid for the express purpose of preventing the sacrifice . The moment that I arrived , I flew to the Convent of St. Clare	1790
for the Cloister . Solitude will perhaps recall her to a sense of her duty : But to prevent your opposing that wished event , I must inform you , Don Alphonso , that your presence here is no longer agreeable either to the Baron or Myself . It was not to talk nonsense to my Niece that your Relations sent you to Germany : Your business was to travel , and I should be sorry to impede any longer so excellent a design . Farewell , Segnor ; Remember , that tomorrow morning we meet for the last time. ” Having said this , She darted upon me a look of pride , contempt , and malice , and quitted the apartment . I also retired to mine , and consumed the night in planning the means of rescuing Agnes	1790
and pursued with unremitting vengeance those who opposed themselves to her wishes . The warmest of Friends , the most inveterate of Enemies , such was the Baroness Lindenberg . I laboured incessantly to please her : Unluckily I succeeded but too well . She seemed gratified by my attention , and treated me with a distinction accorded by her to no one else . One of my daily occupations was reading to her for several hours : Those hours I should much rather have past with Agnes ; But as I was conscious that complaisance for her Aunt would advance our union , I submitted with a good grace to the penance imposed upon me . Donna Rodolpha ’ s Library was principally composed of	1790
quitting him the Baron shook my hand affectionately , and assured me that as soon as his Niece was gone , I might consider his House as my own . “ Farewell , Don Alphonso ! ” said the Baroness , and stretched out her hand to me . I took it , and offered to carry it to my lips . She prevented me . Her Husband was at the other end of the room , and out of hearing . “ Take care of yourself , ” She continued ; “ My love is become hatred , and my wounded pride shall not be unatoned . Go where you will , my vengeance shall follow you ! ” She accompanied these words with a look sufficient to make me tremble . I answered	1790
with a certain mysterious horror . He in vain endeavoured to shake it off . The silence of the night , the story of the Apparition , the chamber wainscotted with dark oak pannells , the recollection which it brought with it of the murdered Elvira , and his incertitude respecting the nature of the drops given by him to Antonia , made him feel uneasy at his present situation . But He thought much less of the Spectre , than of the poison . Should He have destroyed the only object which rendered life dear to him ; Should the Ghost ’ s prediction prove true ; Should Antonia in three days be no more , and He the wretched cause of her death ...... The supposition was too horrible to dwell upon . He drove	1790
all resistance unavailing , and necessity will compel her to receive you in her arms. ” “ Antonia will be in my power ! ” exclaimed the Monk ; “ Matilda , you transport me ! At length then , happiness will be mine , and that happiness will be Matilda ’ s gift , will be the gift of friendship ! I shall clasp Antonia in my arms , far from every prying eye , from every tormenting Intruder ! I shall sigh out my soul upon her bosom ; Shall teach her young heart the first rudiments of pleasure , and revel uncontrouled in the endless variety of her charms ! And shall this delight indeed by mine ? Shall I give the reins to my desires , and	1790
He spoke to him , He insensibly assumed a tone milder than was usual to him ; and no voice sounded so sweet to him as did Rosario ’ s . He repayed the Youth ’ s attentions by instructing him in various sciences ; The Novice received his lessons with docility ; Ambrosio was every day more charmed with the vivacity of his Genius , the simplicity of his manners , and the rectitude of his heart : In short He loved him with all the affection of a Father . He could not help sometimes indulging a desire secretly to see the face of his	1790

Sometimes the Castle rung with oaths and execrations : A Moment after She repeated her Paternoster : Now She howled out the most horrible blasphemies , and then chaunted De Profundis , as orderly as if still in the Choir . In short She seemed a mighty capricious Being : But whether She prayed or cursed , whether She was impious or devout , She always contrived to terrify her Auditors out of their senses . The Castle became scarcely habitable ; and its Lord was so frightened by these midnight Revels , that one fine morning He was found dead in	1790

Let not my prediction grieve you ; Rather with submission bending Calmly wait distress impending , And expect eternal bliss In a better world than this . Having said this , the Gypsy again whirled herself round thrice , and then hastened out of the Street with frantic gesture . The Crowd followed her ; and Elvira ’ s door being now unembarrassed Leonella entered the House out of humour with the Gypsy , with her Niece , and with the People ; In short with every body , but herself	1790
Castle . As my Chaise drove out of the Court , I looked up to the windows of your Sister ’ s chamber . Nobody was to be seen there : I threw myself back despondent in my Carriage . I was attended by no other servants than a Frenchman whom I had hired at Strasbourg in Stephano ’ s room , and my little Page whom I before mentioned to you . The fidelity , intelligence , and good temper of Theodore had already made him dear to me ; But He now prepared to lay an obligation on me ,	1790
He had discovered that his Neighbour was not very conversible ; But whether her silence proceeded from pride , discretion , timidity , or idiotism , He was still unable to decide . After a pause of some minutes— “ It is certainly from your being a Stranger , ” said He , “ and as yet unacquainted with our customs , that you continue to wear your veil . Permit me to remove it. ” At the same time He advanced his hand towards the Gauze : The Lady raised hers to prevent him . “ I never unveil in public , Segnor. ” “ And where is the harm , I pray you ? ” interrupted her Companion somewhat sharply ; “ Do not you see that the other Ladies have all laid their veils	1790
He listened . Some minutes past in silence , after which the murmur was repeated . It appeared to be the groaning of one in pain . In any other situation , this circumstance would only have excited his attention and curiosity : In the present , his predominant sensation was that of terror . His imagination totally engrossed by the ideas of sorcery and Spirits , He fancied that some unquiet Ghost was wandering near him ; or else that Matilda had fallen a Victim to her presumption , and was perishing under the cruel fangs of the Dæmons . The noise seemed not to approach , but continued to be heard at intervals . Sometimes it became more audible , doubtless as the sufferings of the person who uttered	1790
Forgetting the consequences , and only anxious to escape the terrors of the present moment , He made an ample confession . He disclosed every circumstance of his guilt , and owned not merely the crimes with which He was charged , but those of which He had never been suspected . Being interrogated as to Matilda ’ s flight which had created much confusion , He confessed that She had sold herself to Satan , and that She was indebted to Sorcery for her escape . He still assured his Judges that for his own part He had never entered into any compact with the infernal Spirits ; But the threat of being tortured made him declare himself to be	1790

Besides , I have nothing to lose except my life , and that will not be worth the Robbers taking. ” I thought his arguments bad , and advised his waiting till the Morning ; But as the Baroness did not second me , I was obliged to give up the point .

Pablos gave him a strengthening medicine , and advised his keeping his bed for the two succeeding days : He then retired , having desired his Patient not to exhaust himself by conversation , but rather to endeavour at taking some repose . The other Monks followed his example , and the Abbot and Rosario were left without Observers . For some minutes Ambrosio regarded his Attendant with a look of mingled pleasure and apprehension . She was seated upon the side of the Bed , her head bending down , and as usual enveloped in the Cowl of her Habit . “ And you are still here , Matilda ? ” said the Friar at	1790

What means that burning Cross upon your forehead , and why did the sight of it strike such horror to my soul ? ” On these points He for some time refused to satisfy me . At length overcome by my entreaties , He consented to clear up the whole , on condition that I would defer his explanation till the next day . With this request I was obliged to comply , and He	1790
always enough to do with your money , and are not very often disposed to throw it away upon old Women . I advised my Sister to send Antonia with her petition ; But She would not hear of such a thing . She is so obstinate ! Well ! She will find herself the worse for not following my counsels : the Girl has a good pretty face , and possibly might have done much. ” “ Ah ! Segnora , ” interrupted Don Christoval , counterfeiting a passionate air ; “ If a pretty face will do the business	1790
” The Fiend replied not , but continued to gaze upon him in silence . Ambrosio could not sustain his glance ; He turned away his eyes , while thus spoke the Dæmon : “ I have him then in my power ! This model of piety ! This being without reproach ! This Mortal who placed his puny virtues on a level with those of Angels . He is mine ! Irrevocably , eternally mine ! Companions of my sufferings ! Denizens of hell ! How grateful will be my present ! ” He paused ; then addressed himself to the Monk—— “ Carry you to Matilda ? ” He continued , repeating Ambrosio ’ s words : “ Wretch ! you shall soon be with her ! You well deserve a place near her , for hell boasts no	1790
... ! I have no Friend ! The whole wide world can not furnish an heart that is willing to participate in the sorrows of mine ! ” As He uttered these words , He sobbed audibly . The Friar was affected . He took Rosario ’ s hand , and pressed it with tenderness . “ You have no Friend , say you ? What then am I ? Why will you not confide in me , and what can you fear ? My severity ? Have I ever used it with you ? The dignity of my habit ? Rosario , I lay aside the Monk , and bid you consider me as no other than your Friend , your Father . Well may I assume that title , for never did Parent watch over a Child more fondly than I have watched over you	1790
am conscious that all these sage observations are thrown away upon you . Authorship is a mania to conquer which no reasons are sufficiently strong ; and you might as easily persuade me not to love , as I persuade you not to write . However , if you can not help being occasionally seized with a poetical paroxysm , take at least the precaution of communicating your verses to none but those whose partiality for you secures their approbation. ” “ Then , my Lord , you do not think these lines tolerable ? ” said Theodore with an humble and dejected air . “ You mistake my meaning . As I said	1790
already descended some steps when his courage failed him . He remembered Matilda ’ s menaces if He infringed her orders , and his bosom was filled with a secret unaccountable awe . He returned up the stairs , resumed his former station , and waited impatiently for the conclusion of this adventure . Suddenly He was sensible of a violent shock : An earthquake rocked the ground . The Columns which supported the roof under which He stood were so strongly shaken , that every moment menaced him with its fall , and at the same moment He heard a loud and tremendous burst of thunder . It ceased , and his eyes being fixed upon the Staircase , He saw a bright column of light flash along the Caverns beneath . It	1790
perceived sensations in my bosom till then unknown to me ; I found a delight in your society which no one ’ s else could afford ; and when I witnessed the extent of your genius and information , I rejoiced as does a Father in the perfections of his Son . Then lay aside your fears ; Speak to me with openness : Speak to me , Rosario , and say that you will confide in me . If my aid or my pity can alleviate your distress .... ” “ Yours can ! Yours only can ! Ah ! Father , how willingly would I unveil to you my heart ! How willingly	1790
the People among whom I lived , and whose exterior was so polished and seducing , were at bottom frivolous , unfeeling and insincere . I turned from the Inhabitants of Paris with disgust , and quitted that Theatre of Luxury without heaving one sigh of regret . I now bent my course towards Germany , intending to visit most of the principal courts : Prior to this expedition , I meant to make some little stay at Strasbourg . On quitting my Chaise at Luneville to take some refreshment , I observed a splendid Equipage , attended by four Domestics in rich liveries , waiting at the door of the Silver Lion . Soon after as I looked out of the window , I saw a Lady of noble presence , followed by two female Attendants , step into the Carriage ,	1790
begging you not to repeat your visits . I have thrown myself in full confidence upon your honour : I am certain that you will not prove my opinion of you to have been too favourable. ” “ But one question more , Segnora , and I leave you . Should the Duke of Medina approve my love , would my addresses be unacceptable to yourself and the fair Antonia ? ” “ I will be open with you , Don Lorenzo : There being little probability of such an union taking place , I fear that it is desired	1790
her caresses . Her charms becoming accustomed to him , they ceased to excite the same desires which at first they had inspired . The delirium of passion being past , He had leisure to observe every trifling defect : Where none were to be found , Satiety made him fancy them . The Monk was glutted with the fullness of pleasure : A Week had scarcely elapsed before He was wearied of his Paramour : His warm constitution still made him seek in her arms the gratification of his lust : But when the moment of passion was over , He quitted her with disgust , and his humour , naturally inconstant , made him sigh impatiently for variety . Possession , which cloys Man , only increases the affection of Woman .	1790
round my prison , as I shrunk from the cutting wind which howled through my subterraneous dwelling , the change seemed so striking , so abrupt , that I doubted its reality . That the Duke de Medina ’ s Niece , that the destined Bride of the Marquis de las Cisternas , One bred up in affluence , related to the noblest families in Spain , and rich in a multitude of affectionate Friends , that She should in one moment become a Captive , separated from the world for ever , weighed down with chains , and reduced to support life with the coarsest aliments , appeared a change so sudden and incredible , that I believed myself	1790
by no means at a loss in my new station . For some days I continued to work in the Convent Garden without meeting the Object of my disguise : On the fourth Morning I was more successful . I heard the voice of Agnes , and was speeding towards the sound , when the sight of the Domina stopped me . I drew back with caution , and concealed myself behind a thick clump of Trees . The Prioress advanced and seated herself with Agnes on a Bench at no great distance . I heard her in an angry tone blame her Companion ’ s continual melancholy : She told her that to weep the loss of any Lover in her situation was a crime ; But that to weep the loss of a faithless one was folly and absurdity in	1790
to take , and unless you can help me , I shall certainly go distracted . Well , to be sure , never was Woman so unfortunate , as myself ! All in my power to keep clear of such abomination have I done , and yet that all is too little . What signifies my telling my beads four times a day , and observing every fast prescribed by the Calendar ? What signifies my having made three Pilgrimages to St. James of Compostella , and purchased as many pardons from the Pope as would buy off Cain ’ s punishment ? Nothing prospers with me ! All goes wrong , and God only knows , whether any thing will ever go right again ! Why now , be your Holiness the Judge . My Lodger dies in convulsions ; Out of pure kindness	1790
her eyes thanked me for my affection to her Brother . My constant and unremitted attention at length gained me her heart , and with difficulty I obliged her to confess that She loved me . When however , I proposed her quitting the Castle of Lindenberg , She rejected the idea in positive terms . “ Be generous , Alphonso , ” She said ; “ You possess my heart , but use not the gift ignobly . Employ not your ascendancy over me in persuading me to take a step , at which I should hereafter have to blush . I am young and deserted : My Brother , my only Friend , is separated from me , and my other Relations act with me as my Enemies . Take pity on my unprotected situation	1790
pious consolations may soften the agonies of my Parent ’ s deathbed , you will confer an everlasting favour upon hearts not ungrateful. ” With this petition also the Monk complied . Indeed , what petition would He have refused , if urged in such enchanting accents ? The suppliant was so interesting ! Her voice was so sweet , so harmonious ! Her very tears became her , and her affliction seemed to add new lustre to her charms . He promised to send to her a Confessor that same Evening , and begged her to leave her address . The Companion presented him with a Card on which it was written ,	1790
and holy , I swear that your Daughter ’ s honour is still unviolated . Forgive my transgression ! Spare me the shame of a discovery , and permit me to regain the Abbey undisturbed . Grant me this request in mercy ! I promise not only that Antonia shall be secure from me in future , but that the rest of my life shall prove ..... ” Elvira interrupted him abruptly . “ Antonia secure from you ? _I_ will secure her ! You shall betray no longer the confidence of Parents ! Your iniquity shall be unveiled to the public eye : All Madrid shall shudder at your	1790
through Hedges and Ditches , dashed down the most dangerous precipices , and seemed to vye in swiftness with the rapidity of the winds . All this while my Companion lay motionless in my arms . Truly alarmed by the magnitude of the danger , I was in vain attempting to recall her to her senses ; when a loud crash announced , that a stop was put to our progress in the most disagreeable manner . The Carriage was shattered to pieces . In falling I struck my temple against a flint . The pain of the wound , the violence of the shock , and apprehension for the safety of Agnes combined to overpower me so compleatly , that my senses forsook me , and I lay without animation on the ground . I probably remained for some time in this situation , since when I	1790
several lovely Children , dressed as Seraphs . The summit was covered with silver clouds , upon which reclined the most beautiful form that eyes ever witnessed . It was a Damsel representing St. Clare : Her dress was of inestimable price , and round her head a wreath of Diamonds formed an artificial glory : But all these ornaments yielded to the lustre of her charms . As She advanced , a murmur of delight ran through the Crowd . Even Lorenzo confessed secretly , that He never beheld more perfect beauty , and had not his heart been Antonia ’ s , it must have fallen a sacrifice to this enchanting Girl . As it was , He considered her only as a fine Statue : She obtained from him no tribute save cold admiration ,	1790
Crowd was assembled either from motives of piety or thirst of information . But very few were influenced by those reasons ; and in a city where superstition reigns with such despotic sway as in Madrid , to seek for true devotion would be a fruitless attempt . The Audience now assembled in the Capuchin Church was collected by various causes , but all of them were foreign to the ostensible motive . The Women came to show themselves , the Men to see the Women : Some were attracted by curiosity to hear an Orator so celebrated ; Some came because they had no better means of employing their time till	1790
was called into play , their every other sentiment , their every other passion yielded to its irresistible strength . While She was big with Agnes , your Mother was seized by a dangerous illness , and given over by her Physicians . In this situation , Donna Inesilla vowed , that if She recovered from her malady , the Child then living in her bosom if a Girl should be dedicated to St. Clare , if a Boy to St. Benedict . Her prayers were heard ; She got rid of her complaint ; Agnes entered the world alive , and was immediately destined to the service of St. Clare . Don Gaston readily chimed in with his Lady ’ s wishes : But knowing	1790
preparing to obey her ; when Don Ramirez , protected by the Archers from their rage , commanded them to forbear , and threatened them with the severest vengeance of the Inquisition . At that dreaded word every arm fell , every sword shrunk back into its scabbard . The Prioress herself turned pale , and trembled . The general silence convinced her that She had nothing to hope but from innocence , and She besought Don Ramirez in a faultering voice , to inform her of what crime She was accused . “ That you shall know in time , ” replied He ; “ But	1790
Marquis de Villa-Franca , and was accepted with joy and gratitude . Virginia became his Wife , nor did She ever give him cause to repent his choice . His esteem increased for her daily . Her unremitted endeavours to please him could not but succeed . His affection assumed stronger and warmer colours . Antonia ’ s image was gradually effaced from his bosom ; and Virginia became sole Mistress of that heart , which She well deserved to possess without a Partner . The remaining years of Raymond and Agnes , of Lorenzo and Virginia , were happy as can be	1790
of Germany ; and I have been told that the ruins of the Castle of _Lauenstein_ , which She is supposed to haunt , may yet be seen upon the borders of _Thuringia.—The Water-King_ , from the third to the twelfth stanza , is the fragment of an original Danish Ballad—And _Belerma and Durandarte_ is translated from some stanzas to be found in a collection of old Spanish poetry , which contains also the popular song of _Gayferos and Melesindra_ , mentioned in Don Quixote.—I have now made a full avowal of all the plagiarisms of which I am aware myself ; but I doubt not , many more may be found , of which I am at present totally unconscious . CHAPTER I . ——Lord Angelo is precise ; Stands at a guard with envy ; Scarce confesses That his blood flows	1790
power to keep clear of such abomination have I done , and yet that all is too little . What signifies my telling my beads four times a day , and observing every fast prescribed by the Calendar ? What signifies my having made three Pilgrimages to St. James of Compostella , and purchased as many pardons from the Pope as would buy off Cain ’ s punishment ? Nothing prospers with me ! All goes wrong , and God only knows , whether any thing will ever go right again ! Why now , be your Holiness the Judge . My Lodger dies in convulsions ; Out of pure kindness I bury her at my own expence ; ( Not that she is any relation of mine , or that I shall be benefited	1790
of this adventure would justify him in the eyes of Madrid : But whatever might be the consequences , He resolved to profit by the opportunity which chance had presented to him . An expressive look from Matilda confirmed him in this resolution . “ Good Woman , ” said He to Jacintha , “ what you tell me is so extraordinary that I can scarcely credit your assertions . However , I will comply with your request . Tomorrow after Matins you may expect me at your House : I will then examine into what I can do for you , and	1790
give up the point , but by this time the Nuns were out of hearing . The Prioress unlocked the door which communicated with St. Clare ’ s Chapel , and having entered with her Companion , closed it again after them . Matilda now asked , who was this Agnes with whom the Prioress was thus incensed , and what connexion She could have with Ambrosio . He related her adventure ; and He added , that since that time his ideas having undergone a thorough revolution , He now felt much compassion for the unfortunate Nun . “ I design , ” said He , “ to request an audience of the Domina tomorrow , and use every means of obtaining a mitigation of her sentence. ”	1790
Elvira had declared herself no Friend to a monastic life , and the Monk was either candid or complaisant enough to allow that her disapprobation was not unfounded . These proofs of the interest which He felt for her completely won Elvira ’ s heart . In thanking him She exhausted every expression which Gratitude could furnish , and protested that now She should resign herself with tranquillity to the Grave . Ambrosio rose to take leave : He promised to return the next day at the same hour , but requested that his visits might be kept secret . “ I am unwilling ” said He , “ that my breaking through a rule imposed by necessity should	1790
all his Creatures respect this fatal mark ! ” He put his hand to the velvet , which was bound round his forehead . There was in his eyes an expression of fury , despair , and malevolence , that struck horror to my very soul . An involuntary convulsion made me shudder . The Stranger perceived it . “ Such is the curse imposed on me , ” he continued : “ I am doomed to inspire all who look on me with terror and detestation . You already feel the influence of the charm , and with every succeeding moment will feel it more . I will not add to	1790
strove in vain to wake him . He was perfectly insensible to my efforts . I now heard the heavy steps ascending the staircase ; The Door was thrown open , and again the Bleeding Nun stood before me . Once more my limbs were chained in second infancy . Once more I heard those fatal words repeated , ‘ Raymond ! Raymond ! Thou art mine ! Raymond ! Raymond ! I am thine ! & c.—— ’ The scene which had shocked me so sensibly on the former night , was again presented . The Spectre again pressed her lips to mine , again touched me with her rotting fingers , and as on her first appearance , quitted the chamber as soon as the Clock told “ Two. ” Even night was this repeated .	1790
as the Clock strikes One , the Door of the haunted Chamber opens . ( Observe , that this room has been shut up for near a Century . ) Then out walks the Ghostly Nun with her Lamp and dagger : She descends the staircase of the Eastern Tower ; and crosses the great Hall ! On that night the Porter always leaves the Gates of the Castle open , out of respect to the Apparition : Not that this is thought by any means necessary , since She could easily whip through the Keyhole if She chose it ; But merely out of politeness , and to prevent her from making her exit in a way so derogatory to the dignity of her Ghost-ship. ” “ And whither does She go on quitting the Castle ? ” “	1790
in their hands ; and at a little distance from them stood Another wrapped in his cloak , whose stature and appearance bore a strong resemblance to Lorenzo ’ s . She was not deceived in this conjecture . It was indeed Lorenzo himself , who bound by his word not to present himself to Antonia without his Uncle ’ s consent , endeavoured by occasional Serenades , to convince his Mistress that his attachment still existed . His stratagem had not the desired effect . Antonia was far from supposing that this nightly music was intended as a compliment to her : She was too modest to think herself worthy such attentions ; and concluding them to be addressed to	1790
a decree which cuts me to the very heart . Take back your promise . I will quit the Monastery this very day . I have a Relation , Abbess of a Covent in Estramadura : To her will I bend my steps , and shut myself from the world for ever . Yet tell me , Father , shall I bear your good wishes with me to my solitude ? Will you sometimes abstract your attention from heavenly objects to bestow a thought upon me ? ” “ Ah ! Matilda , I fear that I shall think on you but too often for my repose ! ” “ Then I have nothing more to wish for , save that we	1790
continued He in faltering accents , “ I am a Woman ! ” The Abbot started at this unexpected avowal . Prostrate on the ground lay the feigned Rosario , as if waiting in silence the decision of his Judge . Astonishment on the one part , apprehension on the other , for some minutes chained them in the same attitudes , as had they been touched by the Rod of some Magician . At length recovering from his confusion , the Monk quitted the Grotto , and sped with precipitation towards the Abbey . His action did not escape the Suppliant . She sprang from the ground ; She hastened to follow him , overtook him , threw herself in his passage , and embraced his knees . Ambrosio strove in vain to disengage himself from her grasp . “ Do not fly me	1790
. My strong sense of gratitude for your kind offers of service , and ... Shall I confess it ? my desire to behold once more the too amiable Don Christoval , will not permit my obeying her injunctions . I have therefore stolen a moment to inform you , that we lodge in the Strada di San Iago , four doors from the Palace d ’ Albornos , and nearly opposite to the Barber ’ s Miguel Coello . Enquire for Donna Elvira Dalfa , since in compliance with her Father-in-law ’ s order , my Sister continues to be called by her maiden name . At eight this evening you will be sure of finding us : But let	1790
of them should be burnt alive who was found in my dominions after the next three weeks. ” These words were pronounced so audibly that they reached the Gypsy ’ s ears . She immediately pierced through the Crowd and made towards the Ladies . She saluted them thrice in the Eastern fashion , and then addressed herself to Antonia . THE GYPSY “ Lady ! gentle Lady ! Know , I your future fate can show ; Give your hand , and do not fear ; Lady ! gentle Lady ! hear ! ” “ Dearest Aunt ! ” said Antonia , “ Indulge me this once ! Let me have my fortune told me !	1790
Madrid on the Tuesday night , and meant to have the pleasure of presenting her Caro Sposo in form . Though her nuptials were far from pleasing Antonia , Leonella ’ s speedy return gave her Niece much delight . She rejoiced in thinking that She should once more be under a Relation ’ s care . She could not but judge it to be highly improper , for a young Woman to be living among absolute Strangers , with no one to regulate her conduct , or protect her from the insults to which , in her defenceless situation , She was exposed . She therefore looked forward with impatience to the Tuesday night . It arrived . Antonia listened anxiously to	1790
, and they were instantly consumed . The Monk beheld her with anxious curiosity . Suddenly She uttered a loud and piercing shriek . She appeared to be seized with an access of delirium ; She tore her hair , beat her bosom , used the most frantic gestures , and drawing the poignard from her girdle plunged it into her left arm . The blood gushed out plentifully , and as She stood on the brink of the circle , She took care that it should fall on the outside . The flames retired from the spot on which the blood was pouring . A volume of dark clouds rose	1790
fraught with such inexhaustible sweetness ? Can I relinquish these treasures , and leave them to another ’ s enjoyment ? No , Antonia ; never , never ! I swear it by this kiss , and this ! and this ! ” With every moment the Friar ’ s passion became more ardent , and Antonia ’ s terror more intense . She struggled to disengage herself from his arms : Her exertions were unsuccessful ; and finding that Ambrosio ’ s conduct became still freer , She shrieked for assistance with all her strength . The aspect of the Vault , the pale glimmering of the Lamp ,	1790
hastily to regain it . “ Hold ! ” said the Friar in a tone of severity ; “ Daughter , I must read this letter. ” “ Then I am lost ! ” She exclaimed clasping her hands together wildly . All colour instantly faded from her face ; she trembled with agitation , and was obliged to fold her arms round a Pillar of the Chapel to save herself from sinking upon the floor . In the meanwhile the Abbot read the following lines : “ All is ready for your escape , my dearest Agnes . At twelve tomorrow night I shall expect to find you at the Garden door : I have obtained the Key , and a few hours will suffice to place you in a secure asylum . Let no	1790
rising dull the cry ; The Fiend exults ; The Billows dash , And o ’ er their hapless Victim wash. Three times while struggling with the stream , The lovely Maid was heard to scream ; But when the Tempest ’ s rage was o ’ er , The lovely Maid was seen no more . Warned by this Tale , ye Damsels fair , To whom you give your love beware ! Believe not every handsome Knight , And dance not with the Water-Spright ! The Youth ceased to sing . The Nuns were delighted with the sweetness of his voice	1790
few civil speeches which mean nothing to the Aunt , and at the end of an hour I find myself upon the brink of Matrimony ! How will you reward me for having suffered so grievously for your sake ? What can repay me for having kissed the leathern paw of that confounded old Witch ? Diavolo ! She has left such a scent upon my lips that I shall smell of garlick for this month to come ! As I pass along the Prado , I shall be taken for a walking Omelet , or some large Onion running to seed ! ” “ I confess , my poor Count , ” replied Lorenzo , “	1790
’ s prediction : She added , that as He seemed interested in Donna Antonia ’ s welfare , should any change take place in her situation , She would be careful to let him know it . The Monk in replying took pains to raise his voice , hoping that Jacintha would hear it . In this He succeeded ; As He reached the foot of the Stairs with his Conductress , the Landlady failed not to make her appearance . “ Why surely you are not going away , reverend Father ? ” cried She ; “ Did you not promise to pass the night in the haunted Chamber ? Christ Jesus ! I shall be left alone with the Ghost , and a	1790
. I attributed it to excess of fatigue , and the violent effect produced on me by the severity of the season . Whether they believed me or not , I will not pretend to say : They at least ceased to embarrass me with their questions . I strove to divert my attention from the perils which surrounded me , by conversing on different subjects with the Baroness . I talked of Germany , declaring my intention of visiting it immediately : God knows , that I little thought at that moment of ever seeing it ! She replied to me with great ease and politeness , professed that the pleasure of making my acquaintance amply compensated for the delay in her journey , and	1790
flashed full upon her face . At the same moment She dexterously removed the letter from beneath the Image , placed it in her bosom , and hastened to resume her rank in the procession . “ Ha ! ” said Christoval in a low voice ; “ Here we have some little Intrigue , no doubt. ” “ Agnes , by heaven ! ” cried Lorenzo . “ What , your Sister ? Diavolo ! Then somebody , I suppose , will have to pay for our peeping. ” “ And shall pay for it without delay , ” replied the incensed Brother . The pious procession had now entered the Abbey ; The Door was already closed upon it . The Unknown immediately	1790
But the moment that the Clock struck “ One , ” irresistible slumber seized them , nor left them till the departure of the Ghost . You may be surprized that during this time I made no enquiries after your Sister . Theodore , who with difficulty had discovered my abode , had quieted my apprehensions for her safety : At the same time He convinced me that all attempts to release her from captivity must be fruitless till I should be in a condition to return to Spain . The particulars of her adventure which I shall now relate to you , were partly communicated to me by Theodore , and partly by Agnes herself . On the fatal night when her elopement was to have taken place , accident had not permitted her to quit her chamber at the appointed time . At length She ventured into the	1790
but Graves , and Tombs , and Skeletons ! This place frightens me ! Good Ambrosio take me away from it , for it recalls my fearful dream ! Methought I was dead , and laid in my grave ! Good Ambrosio , take me from hence . Will you not ? Oh ! will you not ? Do not look on me thus ! Your flaming eyes terrify me ! Spare me , Father ! Oh ! spare me for God ’ s sake ! ” “ Why these terrors , Antonia ? ” rejoined the Abbot , folding her in his arms , and covering her bosom with kisses which She in vain struggled to avoid : “ What fear you from me , from one who adores	1790
alone in the midst of a dissipated and expensive City ; She was ill provided with money , and worse with Friends . Her aunt Leonella was still at Cordova , and She knew not her direction . Of the Marquis de las Cisternas She heard no news : As to Lorenzo , She had long given up the idea of possessing any interest in his bosom . She knew not to whom She could address herself in her present dilemma . She wished to consult Ambrosio ; But She remembered her Mother ’ s injunctions to shun him as much as possible , and the last conversation which Elvira had held with her upon the subject had given her sufficient lights respecting his designs to put her upon her guard against him in future . Still all her Mother ’ s warnings could	1790
real affection for her , was somewhat comforted by thinking that She had at least one Friend in the World . A Letter was now brought to her , directed to Elvira . She recognized Leonella ’ s writing , and opening it with joy , found a detailed account of her Aunt ’ s adventures at Cordova . She informed her Sister that She had recovered her Legacy , had lost her heart , and had received in exchange that of the most amiable of Apothecaries , past , present , and to come . She added that She	1790
constant long , Perched on the Harp attends the song , Or stifles with a kiss the dulcet notes : Now on the Poet ’ s breast reposes , Now twines his hoary locks with roses , Or borne on wings of gold in wanton circle floats . Then thus Anacreon— “ I no more At other shrine my vows will pour , Since Cupid deigns my numbers to inspire : From Phœbus or the blue-eyed Maid Now shall my verse request no aid , For Love alone shall be the Patron of my Lyre . “ In lofty strain , of earlier days , I spread the King ’ s or Hero ’ s praise , And struck the martial Chords with epic fire : But farewell , Hero ! farewell , King !	1790
the Prioress appeared at the Parlour Grate . Agnes was demanded . The old Lady replied , with a melancholy air , that the dear Child ’ s situation grew hourly more dangerous ; That the Physicians despaired of her life ; But that they had declared the only chance for her recovery to consist in keeping her quiet , and not to permit those to approach her whose presence was likely to agitate her . Not a word of all this was believed by Lorenzo , any more than He credited the expressions of grief and affection for Agnes , with which this account was interlarded . To end the business , He put the Pope ’ s	1790
But whether her silence proceeded from pride , discretion , timidity , or idiotism , He was still unable to decide . After a pause of some minutes— “ It is certainly from your being a Stranger , ” said He , “ and as yet unacquainted with our customs , that you continue to wear your veil . Permit me to remove it. ” At the same time He advanced his hand towards the Gauze : The Lady raised hers to prevent him . “ I never unveil in public , Segnor. ” “ And where is the harm , I pray you ? ” interrupted her Companion somewhat sharply ; “ Do not you see that the other Ladies have all laid their veils aside , to do honour no doubt to the holy place in which we are ? I have taken	1790
her skeleton to be removed to hallowed ground . That Office was reserved for you , and till your coming , her Ghost was doomed to wander about the Castle and lament the crime which She had there committed . However , the Exorciser obliged her to silence during his lifetime . So long as He existed , the haunted chamber was shut up , and the Spectre was invisible . At his death which happened in five years after , She again appeared , but only once on every fifth year , on the same day and at the same hour when She plunged her Knife in the heart of her sleeping Lover : She then visited the Cavern which held her mouldering skeleton , returned to the Castle as soon as	1790
The dagger was also found in the Tomb , where the Monk had thrown it ; and the dungeon having undergone a thorough search , the two Culprits were conveyed to the prisons of the Inquisition . Don Ramirez took care that the populace should remain ignorant both of the crimes and profession of the Captives . He feared a repetition of the riots which had followed the apprehending the Prioress of St. Clare . He contented himself with stating to the Capuchins the guilt of their Superior . To avoid the shame of a public accusation , and dreading the popular fury from which they had already saved their Abbey with much difficulty , the Monks readily permitted the Inquisitors to search their Mansion without noise . No fresh discoveries were made .	1790
. The Strangers seemed earnestly engaged in conversation . They heard not Lorenzo ’ s steps , and He approached unobserved , till He could hear their voices distinctly . “ I protest , ” continued She who was speaking when He arrived , and to whom the rest were listening with great attention ; “ I protest , that I saw them with my own eyes . I flew down the steps ; They pursued me , and I escaped falling into their hands with difficulty . Had it not been for the Lamp , I should never have found you. ” “ And what could bring them hither ? ” said another in a trembling voice ;	1790
her ? You pity her ? Oh ! Father ! Father ! Then pity me ! ” The Friar started ; when after a moment ’ s pause Rosario added with a faltering voice , — “ for my sufferings are still greater . My Sister had a Friend , a real Friend , who pitied the acuteness of her feelings , nor reproached her with her inability to repress them . I ... ! I have no Friend ! The whole wide world can not furnish an heart that is willing to participate in the sorrows of mine ! ” As He uttered these words , He sobbed audibly . The Friar was affected . He took Rosario ’ s hand , and pressed it with tenderness . “ You have	1790
of Cuba , and to have been brought into Spain from that island in the vessel of Columbus . “ And can no possible remedy be found ? ” enquired Rosario . “ Without extracting the poison , He can not recover ; and how to extract it is to me still a secret . All that I can do is to apply such herbs to the wound as will relieve the anguish : The Patient will be restored to his senses ; But the venom will corrupt the whole mass of his blood , and in three days He will exist no longer.	1790
humanity ! Let me return to the House which I have quitted I know not how ; But stay here one moment longer , I neither will , or ought. ” Though the Monk was somewhat startled by the resolute tone in which this speech was delivered , it produced upon him no other effect than surprize . He caught her hand , forced her upon his knee , and gazing upon her with gloting eyes , He thus replied to her . “ Compose yourself , Antonia . Resistance is unavailing , and I need disavow my passion for you no longer . You are imagined dead : Society is for ever lost to you . I possess you here alone ; You are absolutely in my power , and I burn with desires which I must either gratify or die : But	1790
seated myself quietly opposite to the Baroness . A glance upon Marguerite told her that her hint had not been thrown away upon me . How different did She now appear to me ! What before seemed gloom and sullenness , I now found to be disgust at her Associates , and compassion for my danger . I looked up to her as to my only resource ; Yet knowing her to be watched by her Husband with a suspicious eye , I could place but little reliance on the exertions of her good-will . In spite of all my endeavours to conceal it , my agitation was but too visibly expressed upon my countenance . I was pale , and both my words and actions were disordered and embarrassed . The young Men observed this , and enquired	1790
in seeking her . Messengers were now dispatched on all sides to inform him that He would find her safe at his Hotel , and desire him to hasten thither immediately . His absence gave Virginia liberty to bestow her whole attention upon her Patient ; and though much disordered herself by the adventures of the night , no persuasion could induce her to quit the bedside of the Sufferer . Her constitution being much enfeebled by want and sorrow , it was some time before the Stranger was restored to her senses . She found great difficulty in swallowing the medicines prescribed to her : But this obstacle being removed , She easily conquered her disease which proceeded from nothing but weakness . The attention which was paid her , the wholesome food to which She had been	1790
the same thing as if I had not watched you at all . To be sure , I did very wrong in being a Spy upon you , that I can not deny ; But Lord ! your Reverence , how can a poor weak Woman resist curiosity ? Mine was so strong to know what you were doing , that I could not but try to get a little peep , without any body knowing any thing about it . So with that I left old Dame Jacintha sitting by my Lady ’ s Bed , and I ventured to steal into the Closet . Being unwilling to	1790
assembly . Every corner was filled , every seat was occupied . The very Statues which ornamented the long aisles were pressed into the service . Boys suspended themselves upon the wings of Cherubims ; St. Francis and St. Mark bore each a spectator on his shoulders ; and St. Agatha found herself under the necessity of carrying double . The consequence was , that in spite of all their hurry and expedition , our two newcomers , on entering the Church , looked round in vain for places . However , the old Woman continued to move forwards . In vain were exclamations of displeasure vented against her from all sides : In vain was She addressed with— “ I assure you , Segnora , there are no places here. ” — “ I beg , Segnora , that	1790
“ ’ Tis sufficient . Well , Don Lorenzo , I shall acquaint my Sister with your obliging offer , and let you know the result with all expedition . Where may I send to you ? ” “ I am always to be found at the Medina Palace. ” “ You may depend upon hearing from me . Farewell , Cavaliers . Segnor Condé , let me entreat you to moderate the excessive ardour of your passion : However , to prove to you that I am not displeased with you , and prevent your abandoning yourself to despair , receive this mark of my affection , and sometimes bestow a thought upon the absent Leonella. ” As She said this , She extended a lean and wrinkled hand ; which her supposed Admirer kissed with such sorry grace	1790
incensed to grant the pardon which He requested . She protested that She would raise the neighbourhood , and make him an example to all future Hypocrites . Then hastening to the Bed , She called to Antonia to wake ; and finding that her voice had no effect , She took her arm , and raised her forcibly from the pillow . The charm operated too powerfully . Antonia remained insensible , and on being released by her Mother , sank back upon the pillow . “ This slumber can not be natural ! ” cried the amazed Elvira , whose indignation increased with every moment . “ Some mystery is concealed in it ; But tremble , Hypocrite ; all your villainy shall soon be unravelled ! Help ! Help ! ” She exclaimed aloud ; “ Within there ! Flora ! Flora ! ” “ Hear me	1790
your custody . I charge the Prioress of St. Clare with murder , and stake my life for the justice of my accusation. ” A general cry of surprize was uttered by the whole Audience , and an explanation was demanded loudly . The trembling Nuns , terrified at the noise and universal confusion , had dispersed , and fled different ways . Some regained the Convent ; Others sought refuge in the dwellings of their Relations ; and Many , only sensible of their present danger , and anxious to escape from the tumult , ran through the Streets , and	1790
, O ’ er Hill , o ’ er dale , with thee I go. ” The Priest their hands together joins : They dance , while clear the moon-beam shines ; And little thinks the Maiden bright , Her Partner is the Water-spright . Oh ! had some spirit deigned to sing , “ Your Partner is the Water-King ! ” The Maid had fear and hate confest , And cursed the hand which then She prest . But nothing giving cause to think , How near She strayed to danger ’ s brink , Still on She went , and hand in hand The Lovers reached the yellow sand . “ Ascend this Steed with me , my Dear ; We needs must cross the streamlet here ; Ride boldly in ; It is not deep ; The winds	1790
on either side must be unfortunate , I will save my Daughter from those miseries which I have suffered . Without your Uncle ’ s consent , while I live , She never shall be yours . Undoubtedly He will disapprove of the union ; His power is immense , and Antonia shall not be exposed to his anger and persecution. ” “ His persecution ? How easily may that be avoided ! Let the worst happen , it is but quitting Spain . My wealth may easily be realised ; The Indian Islands will offer us a secure retreat ; I have an estate , though not of value , in Hispaniola : Thither will we fly , and I shall consider it to be my native Country , if it	1790
perish by such a death ! To linger out such ages in torture ! Till now , I knew not what it was to hunger ! Hark ! No . No one comes ! They will come no more ! ” She was silent . She shivered , and drew the rug over her naked shoulders . “ I am very cold ! I am still unused to the damps of this dungeon ! ’ Tis strange : But no matter . Colder shall I soon be , and yet not feel it—I shall be cold , cold as Thou art ! ” She looked at the	1790
hastened to his Cell . He closed the door after him , and threw himself upon the bed in despair . The impulse of desire , the stings of disappointment , the shame of detection , and the fear of being publicly unmasked , rendered his bosom a scene of the most horrible confusion . He knew not what course to pursue . Debarred the presence of Antonia , He had no hopes of satisfying that passion which was now become a part of his existence . He reflected that his secret was in a Woman ’ s power : He trembled with apprehension when He beheld the precipice before him , and with rage , when He thought that had it not been for Elvira , He should now have possessed the object of his desires . With the direct imprecations He vowed vengeance against her ; He	1790
” Her mildness had an instantaneous effect upon Ambrosio ’ s feelings . “ Generous Matilda ! ” He replied , taking her hand , “ How far do you rise superior to the foibles of your sex ! Yes , I accept your offer . I have need of an adviser , and a Confident : In you I find every needful quality united . But to aid my pursuits .... Ah ! Matilda , it lies not in your power ! ” “ It lies in no one ’ s power but mine . Ambrosio , your secret is none to me	1790
miserable days did the Villain languish . On the Seventh a violent storm arose : The winds in fury rent up rocks and forests : The sky was now black with clouds , now sheeted with fire : The rain fell in torrents ; It swelled the stream ; The waves overflowed their banks ; They reached the spot where Ambrosio lay , and when they abated carried with them into the river the corse of the despairing monk . Haughty Lady , why shrunk you back when yon poor frail-one drew near ? Was the air infected by her errors ? Was your purity soiled	1790
rest , I contrived to ascend them , and drag myself out of my prison . I now found Myself in a Vault tolerably spacious . Several Tombs , similar in appearance to that whence I had just escaped , were ranged along the sides in order , and seemed to be considerably sunk within the earth . A sepulchral Lamp was suspended from the roof by an iron chain , and shed a gloomy light through the dungeon . Emblems of Death were seen on every side : Skulls , shoulder-blades , thigh-bones , and other leavings of Mortality were scattered upon the dewy ground . Each Tomb was ornamented with a large	1790
, fresh , and melting , and a Chin in whose dimples seemed to lurk a thousand Cupids . Her Habit ’ s long sleeve would have swept along the Chords of the Instrument : To prevent this inconvenience She had drawn it above her elbow , and by this means an arm was discovered formed in the most perfect symmetry , the delicacy of whose skin might have contended with snow in whiteness . Ambrosio dared to look on her but once : That glance sufficed to convince him , how dangerous was the presence of this seducing Object . He closed his eyes , but strove in vain to banish her from his thoughts . There She still moved before him , adorned with all those charms which his heated imagination could supply : Every beauty which He had seen , appeared embellished , and	1790
eyes again dwelt upon her naked breast . She repeated her protestations of eternal love , threw her arms round his neck , and loaded him with kisses : He returned them ; He clasped her passionately to his bosom , and ... the vision was dissolved . Sometimes his dreams presented the image of his favourite Madona , and He fancied that He was kneeling before her : As He offered up his vows to her , the eyes of the Figure seemed to beam on him with inexpressible sweetness . He pressed his lips to hers , and found them warm : The animated form started from the Canvas , embraced him affectionately , and his senses were unable to support delight so exquisite . Such were the scenes , on which his thoughts were employed while sleeping : His unsatisfied Desires placed before	1790
shrieks , Several of the Brothers hastened to the spot , and the Superior was conveyed back to the Abbey . He was immediately put to bed , and the Monk who officiated as Surgeon to the Fraternity prepared to examine the wound . By this time Ambrosio ’ s hand had swelled to an extraordinary size ; The remedies which had been administered to him , ’ tis true , restored him to life , but not to his senses ; He raved in all the horrors of delirium , foamed at the mouth , and four of the strongest Monks were scarcely able to hold him in his bed . Father Pablos , such was the	1790
seemed to imply the Stranger ’ s knowledge of my secret ) “ Fly to him , my Boy ! Entreat him to grant me one moment ’ s conversation ! ” Theodore was surprised at the vivacity of my manner : However , He asked no questions , but hastened to obey me . I waited his return impatiently . But a short space of time had elapsed when He again appeared and ushered the expected Guest into my chamber . He was a Man of majestic presence : His countenance was strongly marked , and his eyes were large , black , and sparkling : Yet there was a something in his look which , the moment that I saw him , inspired me with a secret awe , not	1790
But in a few minutes after the same sound was repeated , and followed by a rustling noise close behind him . He now started from his seat , and looking round him , perceived the Closet door standing half-unclosed . On his first entering the room He had tried to open it , but found it bolted on the inside . “ How is this ? ” said He to himself ; “ How comes this door unfastened ? ” He advanced towards it : He pushed it open , and looked into the closet : No one was there . While He stood irresolute ,	1790
meet me upon the Stairs , and whisk me away with her to the devil ! Oh ! That I had accepted young Melchior Basco ’ s offer ! Then I should have had somebody to protect me ; But now I am a lone Woman , and meet with nothing but crosses and misfortunes ! Thank Heaven , it is not yet too late to repent ! There is Simon Gonzalez will have me any day of the week , and if I live till daybreak , I will marry him out of hand : An Husband I will have , that is determined	1790
spoke thus , the Youths exchanged a malicious smile , which declared that She would be fortunate if She ever reached that Castle herself . This action did not escape me ; But I concealed the emotion which it excited in my breast . I continued to converse with the Lady ; But my discourse was so frequently incoherent , that as She has since informed me , She began to doubt whether I was in my right senses . The fact was , that while my conversation turned upon one subject , my thoughts were entirely occupied by another . I meditated upon the means of quitting the Cottage , finding my way to the Barn ,	1790
the Horn suspended from his neck , declared to be no other than my faithful Claude , whom I had supposed to be already on his way to Strasbourg . Expecting their discourse to throw some light upon my situation , I hastened to put myself in a condition to hear it with safety . For this purpose I extinguished the candle , which stood upon a table near the Bed : The flame of the fire was not strong enough to betray me , and I immediately resumed my place at the window . The objects of my curiosity had stationed themselves directly under it . I suppose that during my momentary absence	1790
to have been defeated by Nelson upon the seas would not have been disgraceful ; it would have spared him all his after enormities . Hitherto his career had been glorious ; the baneful principles of his heart had never yet passed his lips ; history would have represented him as a soldier of fortune , who had faithfully served the cause in which he engaged ; and whose career had been distinguished by a series of successes unexampled in modern times . A romantic obscurity would have hung over the expedition to Egypt , and he would have escaped the perpetration of those crimes which have incarnadined his soul with a deeper dye than that of the purple for which he committed	1810
longer be useful on this station , and Nelson sailed for Leghorn to refit . When his ship went into dock , there was not a mast , yard , sail , or any part of the rigging , but what stood in need of repair , having been cut to pieces with shot . The hull was so damaged that it had for some time been secured by cables , which were served or thrapped round it . CHAPTER IV - Sir J. Jervis takes the Command -- Genoa joins the French -- Bounaparte begins his Career -- Evacuation of Corsica -- Nelson hoists his broad Pennant in the MINERVE -- Action with the SABINA -- Battle off Cape St. Vincent -- Nelson commands the inner Squadron at the Blockade of Cadiz Boat Action in	1810
feeble voice , `` I will ! '' and hastened on board . The crew , perceiving a new commander coming alongside , hoisted their colours again , and fired a broadside . Schroedersee , when he came on deck , found himself surrounded by the dead and wounded , and called to those in the boat to get quickly on board : a ball struck him at that moment . A lieutenant , who had accompanied him , then took the command , and continued to fight the ship . A youth of seventeen , by name Villemoes , particularly distinguished himself on this memorable day . He had volunteered to take	1810
given important tidings to Earl St. Vincent of the movements of that fleet from which he won his title , a second time gave timely and momentous intelligence to the flag of his country . He went on board the VICTORY , and communicated to Nelson his certain knowledge that the combined Spanish and French fleets were bound for the West Indies . Hitherto all things had favoured the enemy . While the British commander was beating up again strong southerly and westerly gales , they had wind to their wish from the N.E. , and had done in nine days what he was a whole month in accomplishing . Villeneuve , finding the Spaniards at Carthagena were not in a fit state of equipment to join him , dared not wait , but hastened on to Cadiz . Sir John Orde necessarily retired at his approach .	1810
owe his restoration to a heretic . '' But Sir James Erskine looked only at the difficulties of the undertaking . `` Twelve hundred men , he thought , would be too small a force to be committed in such an enterprise ; for Civita Vecchia was a regular fortress ; the local situation and climate also were such , that even if this force were adequate , it would be proper to delay the expedition till October . General Fox , too , was soon expected ; and during his absence , and under existing circumstances , he did not feel justified in sending away such a detachment . '' What this general thought it imprudent to attempt , Nelson and Troubridge	1810
a ship 's crew ever performed : 150 were in their beds when he left Calvi ; of them he lost 54 and believed that the constitutions of the rest were entirely destroyed . He was now sent with despatches to Mr. Drake , at Genoa , and had his first interview with the Doge . The French had , at this time , taken possession of Vado Bay , in the Genoese territory ; and Nelson foresaw that , if their thoughts were bent on the invasion of Italy , they would accomplish it the ensuing spring . `` The allied powers ,	1810
of Norwich , saying that he knew no place where it could give him or his family more pleasure to have it kept than in the capital city of the county where he was born . The freedom of that city was voted him on this occasion . But of all the numerous congratulations which he received , none could have affected him with deeper delight than that which came from his venerable father . `` I thank my God , '' said this excellent man , `` with all the power of a grateful soul , for the mercies he has most graciously bestowed on me in preserving you . Not only my few acquaintance here , but the people in general	1810
. My seamen are now what British seamen ought to be -- almost invincible . They really mind shot no more than peas . '' General Dundas had not the same confidence . `` After mature consideration , '' he said in a letter to Lord Hood , `` and a personal inspection for several days of all circumstances , local as well as others , I consider the siege of Bastia , with our present means and force , to be a most visionary and rash attempt ; such as no officer would be justified in undertaking . '' Lord Hood replied that nothing would be more gratifying to his feelings than to have the whole responsibility upon himself ; and that he was ready and willing to undertake the reduction of the place at his own risk with the force and means at present there . General D'Aubant	1810
. This was a point upon which Nelson 's officers knew that it was hopeless to remonstrate or reason with him ; but both Blackwood , and his own captain , Hardy , represented to him how advantageous to the fleet it would be for him to keep out of action as long as possible ; and he consented at last to let the LEVIATHAN and the TEMERAIRE , which were sailing abreast of the VICTORY , he ordered to pass ahead . Yet even here the last infirmity of this noble mind was indulged , for these ships could not pass ahead if the VICTORY continued to carry all her sail ; and so far was Nelson from shortening sail , that it was evident he took pleasure in pressing on , and rendering it impossible for them to obey his own orders	1810
the afternoon-the wind blew fresh from the south-west , and the English began to fear that the foe might be forced to return to port . A little before sunset , however , Blackwood , in the EURYALUS , telegraphed that they appeared determined to go to the westward , `` And that , '' said the admiral in his diary , `` they shall not do , if it is in the power of Nelson and Bronte to prevent them . '' Nelson had signified to Blackwood that he depended upon him to keep sight of the enemy . They were observed so well that all their motions were made known to him ; and as they wore twice , he inferred that they were aiming to	1810
been , and saying , he trusted it was not asking an improper thing to request that the same allowance might be made to him which would be made to a land officer of his rank , which , situated as he was , would be that of a brigadier-general : if this could not be accorded , he hoped that his additional expenses would be paid him . The answer which he received was , that `` no pay had ever been issued under the direction of the War-office to officers of the navy serving with the army on shore . '' He now entered upon a new line of service . The Austrian and Sardinian armies , under General de Vins ,	1810
the British minister nor the British Admiral thought it prudent to appear at court . Their motions were watched ; and the revolutionists had even formed a plan for seizing and detaining them as hostages , to prevent an attack on the city after the French should have taken possession of it . A letter which Nelson addressed at this time to the First Lord of the Admiralty , shows in what manner he contemplated the possible issue of the storm , it was in these words : -- '' My dear lord , there is an old saying , that when things are at the worst they must	1810
upon him by all the states , and princes , and powers to whom his victory gave a respite . The first communication of this nature which he received was from the Turkish sultan , who , as soon as the invasion of Egypt was known , had called upon `` all true believers to take arms against those swinish infidels the French , that they might deliver these blessed habitations from their accursed hands ; '' and who had ordered his `` pashas to turn night into day in their efforts to take vengeance . '' The present of `` his imperial majesty , the powerful , formidable , and most magnificent Grand Seignior , '' was a pelisse	1810
trading with our islands , taking advantage of the register of their ships , which had been issued while they were British subjects . Nelson knew that , by the Navigation Act , no foreigners , directly or indirectly , are permitted to carry on any trade with these possessions . He knew , also , that the Americans had made themselves foreigners with regard to England ; they had disregarded the ties of blood and language when they acquired the independence which they had been led on to claim , unhappily for themselves before they were fit for it ; and he was resolved	1810
in smoke , when Riou desired his men to stand fast , and let the smoke clear off , that they might see what they were about . A fatal order -- for the Danes then got clear sight of her from the batteries , and pointed their guns with such tremendous effect that nothing but the signal for retreat saved this frigate from destruction . `` What will Nelson think of us ? '' was Riou 's mournful exclamation when he unwillingly drew off . He had been wounded in the head by a splinter , and was sitting on a gun , encouraging his men , when , just as the AMAZON showed her stern to the Trekroner battery , his clerk was killed by his side ; and another shot swept away several marines who were hauling in the main-brace . `` Come , then	1810
, the navy would ruin them in gifts . '' To which the lord mayor replied , putting his hand upon the admiral 's shoulder : `` Do you find victories and we will find rewards . '' Nelson , as he said , had kept his word , had doubly fulfilled his part of the contract , but no thanks had been voted for the battle of Copenhagen ; and feeling that he and his companions in that day 's glory had a fair and honourable claim to this reward , he took the present opportunity of addressing a letter to the lord mayor , complaining of the omission and the injustice . `` The smallest services , '' said he , `` rendered by	1810
the great business of a sea officer : all private considerations must give way to it , however painful . '' `` Have you not often heard , '' says he in another letter , `` that salt water and absence always wash away love ? Now I am such a heretic as not to believe that article , for , behold , every morning I have had six pails of salt water poured upon my head , and instead of finding what seamen say to be true , it goes on so contrary to the prescription , that you may	1810
to the king on the first levee-day ; and the gracious manner in which Nelson was then received effectually removed his resentment . Prejudices had been , in like manner , excited against his friend , Prince William Henry . `` Nothing is wanting , sir , '' said Nelson , in one of his letters , `` to make you the darling of the English nation but truth . Sorry am I to say , much to the contrary has been dispersed . '' This was not flattery , for Nelson was no flatterer . The letter in which this passage occurs shows in how wise and noble a manner he dealt with the prince . One of his royal highness 's officers had applied for a court-martial upon a point in which he was unquestionably wrong . His royal highness	1810
-- for some of the gallant men , who received no other honorary badge of their conduct on that memorable day than this copper medal from a private individual , years afterwards , when they died upon a foreign station , made it their last request , that the medals might carefully be sent home to their respective friends . So sensible are brave men of honour , in whatever rank they may be placed . Three of the frigates , whose presence would have been so essential a few weeks sooner , joined the squadron on the twelfth day after the action . The fourth joined a few days after them . Nelson thus received despatches , which rendered it necessary for him to return to Naples . Before he left Egypt he burned three of the prizes ; they could not have been	1810
as little inflammable as so many solid cylinders . The firing recommenced with the ships to leeward of the centre , and continued till about three . At daybreak , the GUILLAUME TELL and the GENEREUX , the two rear ships of the enemy , were the only French ships of the line which had their colours flying ; they cut their cables in the forenoon , not having been engaged , and stood out to sea , and two frigates with them . The ZEALOUS pursued ; but as there was no other ship in a condition to support Captain Hood , he was recalled . It was generally believed by the officers	1810
people of this country have no idea of anything but revenge , and to gain a point would swear ten thousand false oaths . Constant efforts are made to get a man taken up , in order to rob him . The confiscated property does not reach the king 's treasury . All thieves ! It is selling for nothing . His own people , whom he employs , are buying it up , and the vagabonds pocket the whole . I should not be surprised to hear that they brought a bill of expenses against him for the sale . '' The Sicilian court , however , were at this time duly sensible of the services which had been rendered them by the British fleet , and their gratitude to Nelson was	1810
broadside ; then instantly let down her lower-deck ports , for fear of being bearded through them , and never afterwards fired a great gun during the action . Her tops , like those of all the enemy 's ships , were filled with riflemen . Nelson never placed musketry in his tops ; he had a strong dislike to the practice ; not merely because it endangers setting fire to the sails , but also because it is a murderous sort of warfare , by which individuals may suffer , and a commander now and then be picked off ; but which never can decide the fate of a general engagement . Captain Harvey , in the TEMERAIRE , fell	1810
Copenhagen -- far more so than for the British fleet , where the men were accustomed to battle and victory , and had none of those objects before their eyes which rendered death terrible . Nelson sat down to table with a large party of his officers : he was , as he was ever wont to be when on the eve of action , in high spirits , and drank to a leading wind , and to the success of the morrow . After supper they returned to their respective ships , except Riou , who remained to arrange the order of battle with Nelson and Foley , and to draw up instructions . Hardy , meantime , went	1810
in enamel , calling him his dearest friend ; the most virtuous , loyal , and truly brave character he had ever known . The codicil , containing this bequest , concluded with these words , `` God bless him , and shame fall on those who do not say amen . '' Sir William 's pension of L1200 a year ceased with his death . Nelson applied to Mr. Addington in Lady Hamilton 's behalf , stating the important service which she had rendered to the fleet at Syracuse ; and Mr. Addington , it is said , acknowledged that she	1810
were owing to their unhappy circumstances , but that the virtues which they displayed arose from their own nature . This feeling , perhaps , influenced the British court , when , in , Corsica offered to put herself under the protection of Great Britain : an answer was returned , expressing satisfaction at such a communication , hoping that the Corsicans would preserve the same sentiments , but signifying also that the present was not the time for such a measure . These brave islanders then formed a government for themselves , under two leaders , Gaffori and Matra , who had the title of protectors . The latter is represented as a partisan	1810
the rigging that she could not follow her . Nelson , conceiving that this was but the forerunner of a far more serious engagement , called his officers together , and asked them if the ship was fit to go into action against such a superior force without some small refit and refreshment for the men . Their answer was , that she certainly was not . He then gave these orders , -- '' Veer the ship , and lay her head to the westward : let some of the best men be employed in refitting the rigging , and the carpenter in getting crows and capstan-bars to prevent our wounded spars from coming down : and get the wine up for the people	1810
patriotism of the Corsicans , and of their leader Paoli , had been the admiration of England . The history of these brave people is but a melancholy tale . The island which they inhabit has been abundantly blessed by nature ; it has many excellent harbours ; and though the MALARIA , or pestilential atmosphere , which is so deadly in many parts of Italy and of the Italian islands , prevails on the eastern coast , the greater part of the country is mountainous and healthy . It is about 150 miles long , and from 40 to 50 broad ; in circumference , some 320 ; a country large enough , and sufficiently distant from the nearest shores , to have subsisted as an independent state , if the welfare and happiness of the human race had ever been considered as the	1810
in characteristic language , saying , `` So far I am content . The enemy will be distressed ; and , thank God , I shall get no money . The world , I know , think that money is our god ; and now they will be undeceived as far as relates to us . Down , down with the French ! is my constant prayer . '' Odes , sonnets , and congratulatory poems of every description were poured in upon Nelson on his arrival at Naples . An Irish Franciscan , who was one of the poets , not being content with panegyric upon this occasion , ventured on a flight of prophecy , and predicted that Lord Nelson would take Rome with his ships . His lordship reminded Father M'Cormick that	1810
had before caused a quarrel with his son-in-law , and occasioned remonstrances from his truest friends , which produced no other effect than that of making him displeased with them , and more dissatisfied with himself . The Addington administration was just at this time formed ; and Nelson , who had solicited employment , and been made vice-admiral of the blue , was sent to the Baltic , as second in command , under Sir Hyde Parker , by Earl St. Vincent , the new First Lord of the Admiralty . The three Northern courts had formed a confederacy for making England resign her naval rights . Of these courts , Russia	1810
-- my blood boils at the name of Frenchmen ! '' At length , General Fox arrived at Minorca -- and at length permitted Col. Graham to go to Malta , but with means miserably limited . In fact , the expedition was at a stand for want of money ; when Troubridge arriving at Messina to co-operate in it , and finding this fresh delay , immediately offered all that he could command of his own . `` I procured him , my lord , '' said he to Nelson , '' of my cobs -- every farthing and every atom of me shall be devoted to the cause .	1810
his plans of civilising the people . He used to say , that though he had an unspeakable pride in the prospect of the fame to which he aspired ; yet if he could but render his countrymen happy , he could be content to be forgotten . His own importance he never affected to undervalue . `` We are now to our country , '' said he , `` like the prophet Elisha stretched over the dead child of the Shunamite , -- eye to eye , nose to nose , mouth to mouth . It begins to recover warmth , and to revive : I hope it will yet regain full health and vigour . '' But when the four years were expired , France purchased the sovereignty of Corsica from the Genoese for forty millions of livres ; as if the Genoese had	1810
; but I daresay they act on a surer principle , although we seldom fail . '' During this partial action our army appeared upon the heights ; and having reconnoitered the place , returned to St. Fiorenzo . `` What the general could have seen to make a retreat necessary , '' said Nelson , `` I can not comprehend . A thousand men would certainly take Bastia : with five hundred and the AGAMEMNON I would attempt it . My seamen are now what British seamen ought to be -- almost invincible . They really mind shot no more than peas . '' General Dundas had not the same confidence . `` After mature consideration , '' he said in a letter	1810
should discharge the debt by sending six battalions to serve in Corsica for four years . The indignation which this conduct excited in all generous hearts was forcibly expressed by Rousseau , who , with all his errors , was seldom deficient in feeling for the wrongs of humanity . `` You Frenchmen , '' said he , writing to one of that people , `` are a thoroughly servile nation , thoroughly sold to tyranny , thoroughly cruel and relentless in persecuting the unhappy . If you knew of a freeman at the other end of the world , I believe you would go thither for the mere pleasure of extirpating him . ''	1810
none could have affected him with deeper delight than that which came from his venerable father . `` I thank my God , '' said this excellent man , `` with all the power of a grateful soul , for the mercies he has most graciously bestowed on me in preserving you . Not only my few acquaintance here , but the people in general , met me at every corner with such handsome words , that I was obliged to retire from the public eye .

Tears of joy have involuntarily trickled down my furrowed cheeks :	1810
, as they had good reason to be , with the British Government , sensible of its advantages , and attached to it . However this may have been , when they found that the English intended to evacuate the island , they naturally and necessarily sent to make their peace with the French . The partisans of France found none to oppose them . A committee of thirty took upon them the government of Bastia , and sequestrated all the British property ; armed Corsicans mounted guard at every place , and a plan was laid for seizing the viceroy . Nelson , who was appointed to superintend the evacuation , frustrated these projects . At a time when every one else despaired of saving stores , cannon , provisions , or property of any kind , and a privateer	1810
returned to him , in order to be transmitted to the chairman of the Patriotic Fund , that the case might be taken into consideration for the benefit of the sufferer or his family . About half-past nine in the morning of the 19th , the MARS , being the nearest to the fleet of the ships which formed the line of communication with the frigates inshore , repeated the signal that the enemy were coming out of port . The wind was at this time very light , with partial breezes , mostly from the S.S.W . Nelson ordered the signal to be made for a chase in the south-east quarter . About	1810
am insensible to the honours and riches my king and country have heaped upon me -- so much more than any officer could deserve ; yet am I ready to quit this world of trouble , and envy none but those of the estate six feet by two . '' Well had it been for Nelson if he had made no other sacrifices to this unhappy attachment than his peace of mind ; but it led to the only blot upon his public character . While he sailed from Palermo , with the intention of collecting his whole force , and keeping off Maretimo , either to receive reinforcements there if the French were bound upwards , or to hasten to Minorca if that should be their destination , Captain Foote , in the Sea-horse , with the Neapolitan	1810
than in the capital city of the county where he was born . The freedom of that city was voted him on this occasion . But of all the numerous congratulations which he received , none could have affected him with deeper delight than that which came from his venerable father . `` I thank my God , '' said this excellent man , `` with all the power of a grateful soul , for the mercies he has most graciously bestowed on me in preserving you . Not only my few acquaintance here , but the people in general , met me at every corner with such handsome words , that I was obliged to retire from the public eye . The height of glory to which your professional judgment , united with a proper degree of bravery	1810
out as the great object of his army , to the non-cooperation of the British fleet and of the Sardinians . '' To prevent this plea , Nelson again addressed De Vins , requesting only to know the time , and the number of troops ready to embark ; then he would , he said , dispatch a ship to Admiral Hotham , requesting transports , having no doubt of obtaining them , and trusting that the plan would be successful to its fullest extent . Nelson thought at the time that , if the whole fleet were offered him for transports , he would find some other excuse ; and Mr. Drake , who was now appointed to reside at the Austrian headquarters , entertained the	1810
justified the confidence of the sailors ; but they themselves excused the opinion of the generals when they saw what they had done . `` I am all astonishment , '' said Nelson , `` when I reflect on what we have achieved ; regulars , national guards , and a large party of Corsican troops , 4000 in all , laying down their arms to soldiers , marines , and seamen ! I always was of opinion , have ever acted up to it , and never had any reason to repent it , that one Englishman was equal to	1810
and informal . '' Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger , who acted as his aide-de-camp , carried this letter with a flag of truce . Meantime the fire of the ships ahead , and the approach of the RAMILLIES and DEFENCE from Sir Hyde 's division , which had now worked near enough to alarm the enemy , though not to injure them , silenced the remainder of the Danish line to the eastward of the Trekroner . That battery , however , continued its fire . This formidable work , owing to the want of the ships which had been destined to attack it , and the inadequate force of Riou 's little squadron , was comparatively uninjured . Towards the close of the action	1810

'' The present of `` his imperial majesty , the powerful , formidable , and most magnificent Grand Seignior , '' was a pelisse of sables , with broad sleeves , valued at 5000 dols . ; and a diamond aigrette , valued at 18,000 dols. , the most honourable badge among the Turks ; and in this instance more especially honourable , because it was taken from one of the royal turbans . `` If it were worth a million , '' said Nelson to his wife , `` my pleasure would be to see it in your possession . '' The sultan also sent , in a spirit worthy of imitation , a purse of 2000 sequins , to be distributed among the wounded . The mother of the sultan sent him a	1810
return on pain of confiscation of their property , he solicited and obtained permission of the king to return , his estates being very great . It is said that the king , when he granted him this permission , warned him not to take any part in politics ; expressing at the same time his own persuasion that he should recover his kingdom . But neither the king , nor he himself , ought to have imagined that , in such times , a man of such reputation would be permitted to remain inactive ; and it soon appeared that Caraccioli was again in command of the navy , and serving under the republic against his late sovereign . The sailors reported that he was forced to act thus ; and this was believed ,	1810
them , they were struck with his stately person , his dignified manners , and imposing talents . They believed the magnificent promises of foreign assistance which he held out , and elected him king accordingly . Had his means been as he represented them , they could not have acted more wisely than in thus at once fixing the government of their country , and putting an end to those rivalries among the leading families , which had so often proved pernicious to the public weal . He struck money , conferred titles , blocked up the fortified towns which	1810

'' Thus ended the complaint of the Neapolitan court . `` The sole result was , '' says Mr. Coleridge , `` that the governor of Malta became an especial object of its hatred , its fears , and its respect . '' Nelson himself , at the beginning of February , sailed for that island . On the way he fell in with a French squadron bound for its relief , and consisting of the GENEREUX seventy-four , three frigates , and a	1810

Admire the Creator , and all His works , to us incomprehensible ; and do all the good you can upon earth ; and take the chance of eternity without dismay . '' He expired in his wife 's arms , holding Nelson by the hand ; and almost in his last words , left her to his protection ; requesting him that he would see justice done her by the government , as he knew what she had done for her country . He left him her portrait in enamel , calling him his dearest friend ; the most virtuous , loyal , and truly brave character he had ever known . The	1810
against his squadron , that , he says , it seemed a trial who should be tired first ; they of complaining , or he of answering their complaints . But the question of neutrality was soon at an end . An Austrian commissary was travelling from Genoa towards Vado ; it was known that he was to sleep at Voltri , and that he had L10,000 with him -- a booty which the French minister in that city , and the captain of a French frigate in that port , considered as far more important than the word of honour of the one , the duties of the	1810
of all their operations ; and their flight to the West Indies , he thought , had been merely undertaken to take off Nelson 's force , which was the great impediment to their undertaking . Collingwood was gifted with great political penetration . As yet , however , all was conjecture concerning the enemy ; and Nelson , having victualled and watered at Tetuan , stood for Ceuta on the 24th , still without information of their course . Next day intelligence arrived that the CURIEUX brig had seen them on the 19th , standing to the northward . He proceeded off Cape St. Vincent , rather cruising for intelligence than knowing whither to betake himself ; and here a case occurred that more than any other event	1810
seaman , who had served as master 's mate under Captain Suckling in the Dreadnought . He returned a practical seaman , but with a hatred of the king 's service , and a saying then common among the sailors -- '' Aft the most honour ; forward the better man . '' Rathbone had probably been disappointed and disgusted in the navy ; and , with no unfriendly intentions , warned Nelson against a profession which he himself had found hopeless . His uncle received him on board the TRIUMPH on his return , and discovering his dislike to the navy , took the best means of reconciling him to it . He held it out as a reward that , if he attended well	1810
But it is said also that no mark of commendation seems to have been bestowed upon Nelson for his exertion . It has been justly remarked that the spirit of the navy can not be preserved so effectually by the liberal honours bestowed on officers when they are worn out in the service , as by an attention to those who , like Nelson at this part of his life , have only their integrity and zeal to bring them into notice . A junior officer , who had been left with the command at Jamaica , received an additional allowance , for which Nelson had applied in vain . Double pay was allowed to every artificer and seaman employed in the naval yard : Nelson had superintended the whole business of that yard with the	1810
, though it appeared , upon examining the journals of the French officers taken in the action , that the two fleets must actually have crossed on the night of the 22nd of June . During the return to Syracuse , the chances of falling in with them were become fewer . Why Buonaparte , having effected his landing , should not have suffered the fleet to return , has never yet been explained . This much is certain , that it was detained by his command , though , with his accustomed falsehood , he accused Admiral Brueys , after that officer 's death , of having lingered on the coast contrary to orders . The French fleet arrived at Alexandria on the	1810

'' Admiral Graves , who was so situated that he could not discern what was done on board the ELEPHANT , disobeyed Sir Hyde 's signal in like manner ; whether by fortunate mistake , or by a like brave intention , has not been made known . The other ships of the line , looking only to Nelson , continued the action . The signal , however , saved Riou 's little squadron , but	1810
frantically about the room , burst into tears again , and again kissed and embraced every person near her ; exclaiming , ' O brave Nelson ! O God ! bless and protect our brave deliverer ! O Nelson ! Nelson ! what do we not owe you ! O conqueror -- saviour of Italy ! O that my swollen heart could now tell him personally what we owe to him ! ' '' She herself wrote to the Neapolitan ambassador at London upon the occasion , in terms which show the fulness of her joy , and the height of the hopes which it had excited . `` I wish I could give wings , '' said she , `` to the bearer of the news , and at the same time to our most sincere gratitude . The whole of the sea-coast of Italy saved ;	1810
peace , tidings arrived of our final and decisive successes in Egypt ; in consequence of which , the common council voted their thanks to the army and navy for bringing the campaign to so glorious a conclusion . When Nelson , after the action of Cape St. Vincent , had been entertained at a city feast , he had observed to the lord mayor , `` that , if the city continued its generosity , the navy would ruin them in gifts . '' To which the lord mayor replied , putting his hand upon the admiral 's shoulder : `` Do you find victories and we will find rewards . '' Nelson , as he said , had kept his word , had doubly	1810
, it is regarded as a relic . The ALBEMARLE had a narrow escape upon this cruise . Four French sail of the line and a frigate , which had come out of Boston harbour , gave chase to her ; and Nelson , perceiving that they beat him in sailing , boldly ran among the numerous shoals of St. George 's Bank , confiding in his own skill in pilotage . Captain Salter , in the STA . MARGARETTA , had escaped the French fleet by a similar manoeuvre not long before . The frigate alone continued warily to pursue him ; but as soon as he perceived that this enemy was unsupported , he shortened sail	1810
shore ; one effected its escape into Cadiz ; others were destroyed ; four only were saved , and those by the greatest exertions . The wounded Spaniards were sent ashore , an assurance being given that they should not serve till regularly exchanged ; and the Spaniards , with a generous feeling , which would not perhaps have been found in any other people , offered the use of their hospitals for our wounded , pledging the honour of Spain that they should be carefully attended there . When the storm , after the action , drove some of the prizes upon the coast , they declared that the English who were thus thrown into their hands should not be considered as prisoners of war ;	1810
, and afford them matter for jest , as the shot fell in showers a full cable 's length short of its destined aim . A few rounds were returned from some of our leading ships , till they perceived its inutility : this , however , occasioned the only bloodshed of the day , some of our men being killed and wounded by the bursting of a gun . As soon as the main body had passed , the gun vessels followed , desisting from their bombardment , which had been as innocent as that of the enemy ; and , about mid-day , the whole fleet anchored between the island of Huen and Copenhagen . Sir Hyde ,	1810
struck ? '' Hardy answered , `` There was no fear of that . '' Then , and not till then , Nelson spoke of himself . `` I am a dead man , Hardy , '' said he : `` I am going fast : it will be all over with me soon . Come nearer to me . Let my dear Lady Hamilton have my hair , and all other things belonging to me . '' Hardy observed that he hoped Mr. Beatty could yet hold out some prospect of life . `` Oh , no ! '' he replied , `` it is impossible . My back is shot through . Beatty will tell you so . '' Captain Hardy then ,	1810
, and his resources fitted to all occasions , an injustice would have been done to them by his appointment . But if the service were conducted with undeviating respect to seniority , the naval and military character would soon be brought down to the dead level of mediocrity . The armament at Toulon consisted of thirteen ships of the line , seven forty-gun frigates , with twenty-four smaller vessels of war , and nearly 200 transports . Mr. Udney , our consul at Leghorn , was the first person who procured certain intelligence of the enemy 's design against Malta ; and , from his own sagacity , foresaw that Egypt must be their after object . Nelson	1810
blessed habitations from their accursed hands ; '' and who had ordered his `` pashas to turn night into day in their efforts to take vengeance . '' The present of `` his imperial majesty , the powerful , formidable , and most magnificent Grand Seignior , '' was a pelisse of sables , with broad sleeves , valued at 5000 dols . ; and a diamond aigrette , valued at 18,000 dols. , the most honourable badge among the Turks ; and in this instance more especially honourable , because it was taken from one of the royal turbans . `` If it were worth a million , '' said Nelson to his wife , `` my pleasure	1810
of war , and nearly 200 transports . Mr. Udney , our consul at Leghorn , was the first person who procured certain intelligence of the enemy 's design against Malta ; and , from his own sagacity , foresaw that Egypt must be their after object . Nelson sailed from Gibraltar on the 9th of May , with the VANGUARD , ORION , and ALEXANDER , seventy-fours ; the CAROLINE , FLORA , EMERALD , and TERPSICHORE , frigates ; and the BONNE CITOYENNE , sloop of war , to watch this formidable armament . On the 19th , when they were in the Gulf of Lyons , a gale came on from the N.W . It moderated so much on the 20th as to enable them to get their top-gallant masts and yards aloft . After dark it again began to blow	1810
ships of the line and five smaller vessels , put to sea . Admiral Hotham received this information at Leghorn , and sailed immediately in search of them . He had with him fourteen sail of the line , and one Neapolitan seventy-four ; but his ships were only half-manned , containing but 7650 men , whereas the enemy had 16,900 . He soon came in sight of them : a general action was expected ; and Nelson , as was his custom on such occasions , wrote a hasty letter to his wife , as that which might possibly	1810
must set on fire all the prizes that he has taken , without having the power of saving the men who have so nobly defended them . The brave Danes are the brothers , and should never be the enemies , of the English . '' A wafer was given him , but he ordered a candle to be brought from the cockpit , and sealed the letter with wax , affixing a larger seal than he ordinarily used . `` This , '' said he , `` is no time to appear hurried and informal . '' Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger , who acted as his aide-de-camp , carried this	1810

The BELLEROPHON , Captain Darby , passed ahead , and dropped her stern anchor on the starboard bow of the ORIENT , seventh in the line , Brueys ' own ship , of one hundred and twenty guns , whose difference of force was in proportion of more than seven to three , and whose weight of ball , from the lower deck alone , exceeded that from the whole broadside of the BELLEROPHON . Captain Peyton , in the DEFENCE , took his station ahead of the	1810
; and the Danes considered this difficulty as almost insuperable , thinking the channel impracticable for so large a fleet . Nelson himself saw the soundings made and the buoys laid down , boating it upon this exhausting service , day and night , till it was effected . When this was done he thanked God for having enabled him to get through this difficult part of his duty . `` It had worn him down , '' he said , `` and was infinitely more grievous to him than any resistance which he could experience from the enemy . '' At the first council of	1810
The French being to windward , drew inshore ; and the English fleet was becalmed six or seven miles to the westward . L'ALCIDE , of seventy-four guns , struck ; but before she could be taken possession of , a box of combustibles in her fore-top took fire , and the unhappy crew experienced how far more perilous their inventions were to themselves than to their enemies . So rapid was the conflagration , that the French in their official account say , the hull , the masts , and sails , all seemed to take fire at the same moment ; and though the English boats were put out to the assistance of the poor wretches on board , not more than 200 could be saved	1810
received this information at Leghorn , and sailed immediately in search of them . He had with him fourteen sail of the line , and one Neapolitan seventy-four ; but his ships were only half-manned , containing but 7650 men , whereas the enemy had 16,900 . He soon came in sight of them : a general action was expected ; and Nelson , as was his custom on such occasions , wrote a hasty letter to his wife , as that which might possibly contain his last farewell . `` The lives of all , '' said he , `` are in the hand of Him who knows best whether to preserve mine or not ; my character and good name are in my own keeping . '' But however confident the French government	1810
in the cause . '' His wish was for peace on fair terms , because England he thought was draining herself to maintain allies who would not fight for themselves . Lord Hood had now returned to England , and the command devolved on Admiral Hotham . The affairs of the Mediterranean wore at this time a gloomy aspect . The arts , as well as the arms of the enemy , were gaining the ascendancy there . Tuscany concluded peace relying upon the faith of France , which was , in fact , placing itself at her mercy . Corsica was in danger . We had taken that island for ourselves , annexed it formally to the crown of Great Britain , and given it a constitution as free as our own . This was done with the consent of the majority of the inhabitants ; and	1810
, perceiving this , took the station which the GOLIATH intended to have occupied , and totally disabled the GUERRIER in twelve minutes . The third ship which doubled the enemy 's van was the ORION , Sir J. Saumarez ; she passed to windward of the ZEALOUS , and opened her larboard guns as long as they bore on GUERRIER ; then , passing inside the GOLIATH , sunk a frigate which annoyed her , hauled round toward the French line , and anchoring inside , between the fifth and sixth ships from the GUERRIER , took her station on the	1810
and on that same evening , while he was thus delayed , information reached him of the relative situation of the Swedish and British fleets , and the probability of an action . The fleet was nearly ten leagues distant , and both wind and current contrary , but it was not possible that Nelson could wait for a favourable season under such an expectation . He ordered his boat immediately , and stepped into it . Night was setting in , one of the cold spring nights of the north ; and it was discovered , soon after they left the ship , that in their haste they had forgotten to provide him with a boat-cloak . He , however , forbade them to return for one ; and when one of his companions	1810
Medway , saying , `` It will release me for ever from an ungrateful service ; for it is my firm and unalterable determination never again to set my foot on board a king 's ship . Immediately after my arrival in town I shall wait on the First Lord of the Admiralty , and resign my commission . '' The officer to whom he thus communicated his intentions behaved in the wisest and most friendly manner ; for finding it in vain to dissuade him in his present state of feeling , he secretly interfered with the First Lord to save him from a step so injurious to himself , little foreseeing how deeply the welfare and honour of England were at that moment at stake . This interference produced a letter from Lord Howe the day before the ship was paid	1810
and thus cut off the communication of the Spaniards between their northern and southern possessions in America . Here it is that a canal between the two seas may most easily be formed -- a work more important in its consequences than any which has ever yet been effected by human power . Lord George Germaine , at that time secretary of state for the American Department , approved the plan ; and as discontents at that time were known to prevail in the Nuevo Reyno , in Popayan , and in Peru , the more sanguine part of the English began to dream of acquiring an empire in one part of America , more extensive than that which they were on the point of losing in another . General Dalling 's plans were well formed ; but the history and the	1810
It is my turn now ; and if I come back , it is yours . '' The American , who had carried a heavy press of sail in hope of escaping , was so completely water-logged that the LOWESTOFFE 's boat went in on deck and out again with the sea . About this time he lost his uncle . Captain Locker , however , who had perceived the excellent qualities of Nelson , and formed a friendship for him which continued during his life , recommended him warmly to Sir Peter Parker , then commander-in-chief upon that station . In consequence of this recommendation he was removed into the BRISTOL flag-ship , and Lieutenant Cuthbert Collingwood succeeded him in the	1810
came back with information that the ice , though close all about them , was open to the westward , round the point by which they came in . They said also , that upon the island they had had a fresh east wind . This intelligence considerably abated the hopes of the crew ; for where they lay it had been almost calm , and their main dependence had been upon the effect of an easterly wind in clearing the bay . There was but one alternative : either to wait the event of the weather upon the ships , or to betake themselves to the boats . The likelihood that it might be necessary to sacrifice the ships had been foreseen	1810
falsehood , and commencing prosecutions against him accordingly . They laid their damages at the enormous amount of L40,000 ; and Nelson was obliged to keep close on board his own ship , lest he should be arrested for a sum for which it would have been impossible to find bail . The marshal frequently came on board to arrest him , but was always prevented by the address of the first lieutenant , Mr. Wallis . Had he been taken , such was the temper of the people that it was certain he would have been cast for the whole sum . One of his officers , one day , in speaking of the restraint which he was thus compelled to suffer , happened to use the word PITY ! `` Pity !	1810
regulate and lead the way to the attack . They were to land on the mole , and thence hasten as fast as possible into the great square ; then form and proceed as should be found expedient . They were not discovered till about half-past one o'clock , when , being within half gun-shot of the landing-place , Nelson directed the boats to cast off from each other , give a huzza , and push for the shore . But the Spaniards were exceedingly well prepared ; the alarm-bells answered the huzza , and a fire of thirty or forty pieces of cannon , with musketry from one end of the town to the other , opened upon the invaders . Nothing , however , could	1810
professional judgment , united with a proper degree of bravery , guarded by Providence , has raised you , few sons , my dear child , attain to , and fewer fathers live to see . Tears of joy have involuntarily trickled down my furrowed cheeks : who could stand the force of such general congratulation ? The name and services of Nelson have sounded through this city of Bath -- from the common ballad-singer to the public theatre . '' The good old man concluded by telling him that the field of glory , in which he had so long been conspicuous , was still open ,	1810
wrested an oar from one of the men ; and it was with the utmost difficulty that the crew could prevent them from staving or upsetting her , till the CARCASS 's boat came up ; and the walruses , finding their enemies thus reinforced , dispersed . Young Nelson exposed himself in a more daring manner . One night , during the mid-watch , he stole from the ship with one of his comrades , taking advantage of a rising fog , and set off over the ice in pursuit of a bear . It was not long before they were missed . The fog	1810
ships , thought they had kept too far on the starboard direction , and made signal for them to close with the enemy , not knowing that they were aground ; but when he perceived that they did not obey the signal , he ordered the ELEPHANT 's helm to starboard , and went within these ships : thus quitting the appointed order of sailing , and guiding those which were to follow . The greater part of the fleet were probably , by this act of promptitude on his part , saved from going on shore . Each ship , as she arrived nearly opposite to her appointed station , let her anchor go by the stern , and presented her broadside to the Danes . The distance between each was about	1810
to remain too far dispersed , and in some disorder . When the morning of the 14th broke , and discovered the English fleet , a fog for some time concealed their number . That fleet had heard their signal-guns during the night , the weather being fine though thick and hazy ; soon after daylight they were seen very much scattered , while the British ships were in a compact little body . The look-out ship of the Spaniards , fancying that her signal was disregarded because so little notice seemed to be taken of it , made another signal , that the English force	1810
can not , shall not be . '' An end was put to this uncomfortable state of mind when , fortunately ( on that account ) for him , as well as happily for the nation , the peace of Amiens was just at this time signed . Nelson rejoiced that the experiment was made , but was well aware that it was an experiment . He saw what he called the misery of peace , unless the utmost vigilance and prudence were exerted ; and he expressed , in bitter terms , his proper indignation at the manner in which the mob of London welcomed the French general who brought the ratification saying , `` that they made him ashamed of his country . '' He had purchased a house and estate at Merton , in Surrey , meaning to pass his days there in the society of Sir	1810
of his fleet was so earnestly requested , because the royal family thought their persons would be safer , in case of any mishap , under the British flag , than under their own . His first object was the recovery of Malta -- an island which the King of Naples pretended to claim . The Maltese , whom the villanous knights of their order had betrayed to France , had taken up arms against their rapacious invaders , with a spirit and unanimity worthy of the highest praise . They blockaded the French garrison by land , and a small squadron , under Captain Ball , began to blockade them by sea , on the 12th of October . Twelve days afterwards Nelson arrived . `` It is as I suspected , '' he says : `` the ministers at Naples know nothing of	1810
Fort St. Elmo would be greatly expedited . They were strong places , and there was reason to apprehend that the French fleet might arrive to relieve them . Ruffo proposed to the garrison to capitulate , on condition that their persons and property should be guaranteed , and that they should , at their own option , either be sent to Toulon or remain at Naples , without being molested either in their persons or families . This capitulation was accepted : it was signed by the cardinal , and the Russian and Turkish commanders ; and lastly , by Captain Foote , as commander of the British force . About six-and-thirty hours afterwards Nelson arrived in the bay with a force which had joined him during his cruise ,	1810
and preserver . From all the boats around he was saluted with the same appellations : the multitude who surrounded him when he landed repeated the same enthusiastic cries ; and the lazzaroni displayed their joy by holding up birds in cages , and giving them their liberty as he passed . His birth-day , which occurred a week after his arrival , was celebrated with one of the most splendid fetes ever beheld at Naples . But , notwithstanding the splendour with which he was encircled , and the flattering honours with which all ranks welcomed him , Nelson was fully sensible of the depravity , as well as weakness , of those by whom he was surrounded . `` What precious moments , '' said he , `` the courts of Naples and Vienna are losing ! Three months would liberate Italy ! but this	1810
, acting upon shore , under Troubridge . The French commandant at St. Elmo , relying upon the strength of the place , and the nature of the force which attacked it , had insulted Captain Foote in the grossest terms ; but CITOYEN Mejan was soon taught better manners , when Troubridge , in spite of every obstacle , opened five batteries upon the fort . He was informed that none of his letters , with the insolent printed words at the top , LIBERTE EQALITE , GUERRE AUX TYRANS , & c. would be received ; but that if he wrote like a soldier and a gentleman he would	1810
there he received an answer to his last despatch from Revel , in which the Russian court expressed their regret that there should have been any misconception between them ; informed him that the British vessels which Paul had detained were ordered to be liberated , and invited him to Petersburgh , in whatever mode might be most agreeable to himself . Other honours awaited him : the Duke of Mecklenburgh Strelitz , the queen 's brother , came to visit him on board his ship ; and towns of the inland parts of Mecklenburgh sent deputations , with their public books of record , that they might have the name of Nelson in them written by his own hand . From Rostock the fleet returned to Kioge Bay . Nelson saw that the temper of the Danes towards England was	1810
the 5th instant , expressing your readiness to serve , and have read the same to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty . '' On the 12th of December he received this dry acknowledgment . The fresh mortification did not , however , affect him long ; for , by the joint interest of the Duke and Lord Hood , he was appointed , on the 30th of January following , to the AGAMEMNON , of sixty-four guns .

But long it can not , shall not be . '' An end was put to this uncomfortable state of mind when , fortunately ( on that account ) for him , as well as happily for the nation , the peace of Amiens was just at this time signed . Nelson rejoiced that the experiment was made , but was well aware that it was an experiment . He saw what he called the misery of peace , unless the utmost vigilance and prudence were exerted ; and he expressed , in bitter terms , his proper indignation at the manner in	1810
not for a moment losing his presence of mind , he observed , as they were carrying him down the ladder , that the tiller ropes , which had been shot away , were not yet replaced , and ordered that new ones should be rove immediately . Then , that he might not be seen by the crew , he took out his handkerchief , and covered his face and his stars . Had he but concealed these badges of honour from the enemy , England , perhaps , would not have had cause to receive with sorrow the	1810
was seeking it , Captain Locker came on deck . Perceiving the boat still alongside , and in danger every moment of being swamped , and being extremely anxious that the privateer should be instantly taken in charge , because he feared that It would otherwise founder , he exclaimed , `` Have I no officer in the ship who can board the prize ? '' Nelson did not offer himself immediately , waiting , with his usual sense of propriety , for the first lieutenant 's return ; but hearing the master volunteer , he jumped into the boat , saying , `` It is my turn now ; and if I come back , it is yours . '' The American , who had carried a heavy press of sail in hope of escaping , was so completely water-logged that the LOWESTOFFE 's boat went in on deck	1810
his way home from thence . This intention was not executed ; but he returned in a brig , declining to accept a frigate , which few admirals would have done , especially if , like him , they suffered from sea-sickness in a small vessel . On his arrival at Yarmouth , the first thing he did was to visit the hospital and see the men who had been wounded in the late battle -- that victory which had added new glory to the name of Nelson , and which was of more importance even than the battle of the Nile to the honour , the strength , and security of England . The feelings of Nelson 's friends , upon the news of his great victory at Copenhagen , were highly described by Sir William Hamilton in a letter to him . `` We can	1810
, there to wait patiently for what might happen . There the fleet remained till dispatches arrived from home , on the 5th of May , recalling Sir Hyde , and appointing Nelson commander-in-chief . Nelson wrote to Earl St. Vincent that he was unable to hold this honourable station . Admiral Graves also was so ill as to be confined to his bed ; and he entreated that some person might come out and take the command . `` I will endeavour , '' said he , `` to do my best while I remain ; but , my dear lord , I shall either soon go to heaven , I hope , or must rest quiet for a time . If Sir Hyde were gone , I would now be under sail . '' On the day	1810
that I am insensible to the honours and riches my king and country have heaped upon me -- so much more than any officer could deserve ; yet am I ready to quit this world of trouble , and envy none but those of the estate six feet by two . '' Well had it been for Nelson if he had made no other sacrifices to this unhappy attachment than his peace of mind ; but it led to the only blot upon his public character . While he sailed from Palermo , with the intention of collecting his whole force , and keeping off Maretimo , either to receive reinforcements there if the French were bound upwards , or to hasten to Minorca if that should be their destination , Captain Foote , in the Sea-horse , with	1810
go on , '' said he : `` remember , brother , it was left to our honour ! '' -- There were some fine pears growing in the schoolmaster 's garden , which the boys regarded as lawful booty , and in the highest degree tempting ; but the boldest among them were afraid to venture for the prize . Horatio volunteered upon this service : he was lowered down at night from the bedroom window by some sheets , plundered the tree , was drawn up with the pears , and then distributed them among his school-fellows without reserving any for himself . `` He only took them , '' he said , `` because every other boy was afraid . '' Early on a cold and dark spring morning Mr. Nelson 's servant arrived at this	1810
few weeks after this event , the war was renewed ; and the day after his Majesty 's message to Parliament , Nelson departed to take the command of the Mediterranean fleet . The war he thought , could not be long ; just enough to make him independent in pecuniary matters . He took his station immediately off Toulon ; and there , with incessant vigilance , waited for the coming out of the enemy . The expectation of acquiring a competent fortune did not last long . `` Somehow , '' he says , `` my mind is not sharp enough for prize-money . Lord Keith would have made L20,000 , and I have not made L6000 . '' More than once he says that the prizes taken in the	1810
was to be pitied who fancied that getting up was either dangerous or difficult . Every day he went into the school-room to see that they were pursuing their nautical studies ; and at noon he was always the first on deck with his quadrant . Whenever he paid a visit of ceremony , some of these youths accompanied him ; and when he went to dine with the governor at Barbadoes , he took one of them in his hand , and presented him , saying , `` Your Excellency must excuse me for bringing one of my midshipmen . I make it a rule to introduce them to all the good company I can , as they have few to look up to , besides myself , during the time they are at sea . '' When Nelson arrived in the West Indies , he found	1810
labour he had obtained -- not of rest , for it was purchased with the loss of a limb ; and the greater part of the time had been a season of constant pain . As soon as his shattered frame had sufficiently recovered for him to resume his duties , he was called to services of greater importance than any on which he had hitherto been employed , which brought with them commensurate fatigue and care . The anxiety which he endured during his long pursuit of the enemy , was rather changed in its direction than abated by their defeat ; and this constant wakefulness of thought , added to the effect of his wound , and the exertions from which it was	1810
the court , and all disinterested persons , were perfectly aware that the enemy had no other object than conquest and plunder . The battle of the Nile shook the power of France . Her most successful general , and her finest army , were blocked up in Egypt -- hopeless , as it appeared , of return ; and the government was in the hands of men without talents , without character , and divided among themselves . Austria , whom Buonaparte had terrified into a peace , at a time when constancy on her part would probably have led to his destruction , took advantage of the crisis to renew the war . Russia also	1810
his own judgment . Sir John Jervis offered him the ST. GEORGE , ninety , or the ZEALOUS , seventy-four , and asked if he should have any objection to serve under him with his flag . He replied , that if the AGAMEMNON were ordered home , and his flag were not arrived , he should , on many accounts , wish to return to England ; still , if the war continued , he should be very proud of hoisting his flag under Sir John 's command , `` We can not spare you , '' said Sir John , `` either as captain or admiral . '' Accordingly , he resumed his station in the	1810
information as any officer in the fleet . The Duke -- who , to his own honour , became from that time the firm friend of Nelson -- describes him as appearing the merest boy of a captain he had ever seen , dressed in a full laced uniform , an old-fashioned waistcoat with long flaps , and his lank unpowdered hair tied in a stiff Hessian tail of extraordinary length ; making altogether so remarkable a figure , that , says the duke , `` I had never seen anything like it before , nor could I imagine who he was , nor what he came about .	1810
Huzza , mates , all together ! ” shouted Merry ; and the foremost broke into a run . And suddenly , not ten yards further , we beheld them stop . A low cry arose . Silver doubled his pace , digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed ; and next moment he and I had come also to a dead halt . Before us was a great excavation , not very recent , for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom . In this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn around . On one of	1880
the great conquest I had made . I should , I think , have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face . It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness -- a haggard old man ’ s smile ; but there was , besides that , a grain of derision , a shadow of treachery , in his expression as he craftily watched , and watched , and watched me at my work . XXVI Israel Hands The wind , serving us	1880
that was to die . The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand , crying like a child . “ Be I going , doctor ? ” he asked . “ Tom , my man , ” said I , “ you ’ re going home. ” “ I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first , ” he replied . “ Tom , ” said the squire , “ say you forgive me , won ’ t you ? ” “ Would that be respectful like , from me to you , squire ? ” was the answer	1880
open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and I remember this one puzzled me . He was not sailorly , and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too . I asked him what was for his service , and he said he would take rum ; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it , he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near . I paused where I was , with my napkin in my hand . “ Come here , sonny , ” says he . “ Come nearer here. ” I took	1880
as thought , I sprang into the mizzen shrouds , rattled up hand over hand , and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees . I had been saved by being prompt ; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight ; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine , a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment . Now that I had a moment to myself , I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol , and then , having	1880
with his talk to old Taylor , the gardener , on a new cure for the rheumatics . In the meantime , the captain gradually brightened up at his own music , and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence . The voices stopped at once , all but Dr. Livesey ’ s ; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two . The captain glared at him for a while , flapped his hand again , glared still harder , and at last broke out with a villainous , low oath , “ Silence , there , between decks ! ” “ Were you addressing me , sir ? ” says the doctor ; and when the ruffian had	1880
The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys . Squire and Gray fired again and yet again ; three men fell , one forwards into the enclosure , two back on the outside . But of these , one was evidently more frightened than hurt , for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees . Two had bit the dust , one had fled , four had made good their footing inside our defences , while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men , each evidently supplied with several muskets , kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house . The	1880

Heaven knows , I can not find it in my heart to blame you , but this much I will say , be it kind or unkind : when Captain Smollett was well , you dared not have gone off ; and when he was ill and couldn ’ t help it , by George , it was downright cowardly ! ” I will own that I here began to weep . “ Doctor , ” I said , “ you might spare me . I have blamed myself enough ; my life ’ s forfeit anyway , and I should have	1880

You save your witness , and he ’ ll save your neck ! ” I began dimly to understand . “ You mean all ’ s lost ? ” I asked . “ Aye , by gum , I do ! ” he answered . “ Ship gone , neck gone -- that ’ s the size of it . Once I looked into that bay , Jim Hawkins , and seen no schooner -- well , I ’ m tough , but I gave out . As for that lot and their council , mark me , they ’ re outright fools and cowards . I ’ ll save	1880
high , adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass and rising again towards the south into the rough , cliffy eminence called the Mizzenmast Hill . The top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height . Every here and there , one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours , and which of these was the particular “ tall tree ” of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot , and by the readings of the compass . Yet , although that was the case , every man on board the boats had picked a favourite	1880
scraps that tended to the same purpose , this whole clause was audible : “ Not another man of them ’ ll jine. ” Hence there were still faithful men on board . When Dick returned , one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank -- one “ To luck , ” another with a “ Here ’ s to old Flint , ” and Silver himself saying , in a kind of song , “ Here ’ s to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff. ” Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me	1880
chin on his chest , his hands lying open before him on the deck , his face as white , under its tan , as a tallow candle . For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse , the sails filling , now on one tack , now on another , and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain . Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship ’ s bows against the swell ; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made	1880
a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire was hard at work at Bristol ; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures . I brooded by the hour together over the map , all the details of which I well remembered . Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper ’ s room , I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; I explored every acre of its surface ; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass , and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects . Sometimes the isle was thick with savages , with whom we fought , sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted	1880
Dooty is dooty , to be sure . Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night . I don ’ t deny it was a good lay . Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end . And I ’ ll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that ’ s why I ’ m here for terms . But you mark me , Cap ’ n , it won ’ t do twice , by thunder ! We ’ ll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum	1880
the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance ; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look . Certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts , and certainly I read them like print . In the immediate nearness of the gold , all else had been forgotten : his promise and the doctor ’ s warning were both things of the past , and I could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure , find and board the HISPANIOLA under cover	1880
t count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day -- you , John , with your head broke -- or you , George Merry , that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone , and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock ? And maybe , perhaps , you didn ’ t know there was a consort coming either ? But there is , and not so long till then ; and we ’ ll see who ’ ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that . And as for number two , and why I made a bargain -- well , you came crawling on your knees to me to make it -- on your knees you came , you was that downhearted -- and you	1880
do you hear me ? ” There was no answer from the forecastle . “ It ’ s to you , Abraham Gray -- it ’ s to you I am speaking. ” Still no reply . “ Gray , ” resumed Mr. Smollett , a little louder , “ I am leaving this ship , and I order you to follow your captain . I know you are a good man at bottom , and I dare say not one of the lot of you ’ s as bad as he makes out . I have my watch here in my hand ; I give you thirty seconds	1880
I suppose , I had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else , for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau . Accordingly , it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him . “ Drunk or raving , ” said he . “ Right you were , sir , ” replied Silver ; “ and precious little odds which , to you and me. ” “ I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man , ” returned the doctor with a sneer , “ and so my feelings may surprise you , Master Silver . But if I were sure they were raving -- as I am morally certain one , at least , of them is down with	1880
sun , and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze . All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes ; a wild duck flew up with a quack , another followed , and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air . I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen . Nor was I deceived , for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice , which , as I continued to give ear , grew steadily	1880
in their heads ; their feet grew speedier and lighter ; their whole soul was bound up in that fortune , that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure , that lay waiting there for each of them . Silver hobbled , grunting , on his crutch ; his nostrils stood out and quivered ; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance ; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look . Certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts , and certainly I read them	1880
you ’ d have starved too if I hadn ’ t -- but that ’ s a trifle ! You look there -- that ’ s why ! ” And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognized -- none other than the chart on yellow paper , with the three red crosses , that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain ’ s chest . Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy . But if it were inexplicable to me , the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers . They leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse . It went from hand to hand , one tearing it from another ; and	1880
the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot , one of them -- I know not which it was -- leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry , whipped his musket to his shoulder , and sent a shot whistling over Silver ’ s head and through the main-sail . After that , we kept under cover of the bulwarks , and when next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit , and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance . That was ,	1880
, and three of them -- Trelawney , Redruth , and the captain -- over six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry . Add to that the powder , pork , and bread-bags . The gunwale was lipping astern . Several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards . The captain made us trim the boat , and we got her to lie a little more evenly . All the same , we were afraid to breathe . In the second place , the ebb was now making -- a strong rippling current running westward through the basin , and then south ’ ard and seaward down the straits by which we had	1880
; and he still lives , a great favourite , though something of a butt , with the country boys , and a notable singer in church on Sundays and saints ’ days . Of Silver we have heard no more . That formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life ; but I dare say he met his old Negress , and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint . It is to be hoped so , I suppose , for his chances of comfort in another world are very small . The bar silver and the arms still lie , for all that	1880
I rose to my feet , I saw , some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes , an isolated rock , pretty high , and peculiarly white in colour . It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one . Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear , or shoreward side , of the stockade , and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party . I had soon told my story and began to look about me . The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine -- roof , walls , and floor .	1880
been wrong about the crew , that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well . As for the ship , he had taken a downright fancy to her . “ She ’ ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir . But , ” he would add , “ all I say is , we ’ re not home again , and I don ’ t like the cruise. ” The squire , at this , would turn away and	1880
was more than enough to disgust me of that landing-place . I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils . In the meantime I had a better chance , as I supposed , before me . North of Haulbowline Head , the land runs in a long way , leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand . To the north of that , again , there comes another cape -- Cape of the Woods , as it was marked upon the chart -- buried in tall green pines , which descended to the margin of the sea . I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island , and seeing from my position that I was already under its influence , I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me	1880
his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hands as free as possible . It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and propped against it , yielding to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore . Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck . He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces -- Long John ’ s earrings , they were called ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now using the crutch , now	1880
, I needn ’ t tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline . I ’ ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose. ” Then he went the rounds and saw , as he said , that all was clear . On the two short sides of the house , east and west , there were only two loopholes ; on the south side where the porch was , two again ; and on the north side , five . There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us ; the firewood had been built into four piles -- tables , you might say -- one about the middle of each side , and on	1880
another tack , sailed swiftly for a minute or so , and brought up once more dead in the wind ’ s eye . Again and again was this repeated . To and fro , up and down , north , south , east , and west , the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes , and at each repetition ended as she had begun , with idly flapping canvas . It became plain to me that nobody was steering . And if so , where were the men ? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her , I thought , and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain . The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate . As for the latter ’ s sailing , it was so wild and intermittent , and she	1880
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling . The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I ’ m bound to say that I require an explanation of his words . You don ’ t , you say , like this cruise . Now , why ? ” “ I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , ” said the captain . “ So far so good . But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do . I don ’ t call that fair , now , do you ? ” “ No , ” said Dr. Livesey , “ I don ’ t.	1880
the open stood one of the hills , with two quaint , craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun . I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration . The isle was uninhabited ; my shipmates I had left behind , and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls . I turned hither and thither among the trees . Here and there were flowering plants , unknown to me ; here and there I saw snakes , and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top . Little did I suppose	1880
ll talk Mr. Hawkins over , we will , and we ’ ll give him his share , to be sure , for all his kindness. ” It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now . For my part , I was horribly cast down . Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible , Silver , already doubly a traitor , would not hesitate to adopt it . He had still a foot in either camp , and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging , which was the best he had to hope on our side . Nay , and even if things so fell out	1880
were , sir , ” replied Silver ; “ and precious little odds which , to you and me. ” “ I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man , ” returned the doctor with a sneer , “ and so my feelings may surprise you , Master Silver . But if I were sure they were raving -- as I am morally certain one , at least , of them is down with fever -- I should leave this camp , and at whatever risk to my own carcass , take them the assistance of my skill. ” “ Ask your pardon , sir , you would be very wrong , ” quoth Silver . “ You would lose	1880
said he -- “ I told you you had sp ’ iled your Bible . If it ain ’ t no good to swear by , what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it ? Not that ! ” and he snapped his big fingers , halting a moment on his crutch . But Dick was not to be comforted ; indeed , it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick ; hastened by heat , exhaustion , and the shock of his alarm , the fever , predicted by Dr. Livesey , was evidently growing swiftly higher . It	1880
the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver . “ See here , now , Hawkins , ” said he , “ here ’ s a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ain ’ t it ? There ’ s Cap ’ n Trelawney -- what ’ s he to think ? Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of	1880
my destination ; the double hill behind me and the Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter ; the stars were few and pale ; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits . Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me . I looked up ; a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass , and soon after I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees , and knew the moon had risen . With this to help me , I passed rapidly over	1880
” “ We ’ re willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it . All I ask is your word , Cap ’ n Smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o ’ shot before a gun is fired. ” “ My man , ” said Captain Smollett , “ I have not the slightest desire to talk to you . If you wish to talk to me , you can come , that ’ s all . If there ’ s any treachery , it ’ ll be on your side , and the Lord help	1880
said I . “ Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ? He was one of them. ” “ So ? ” cried Silver . “ In my house ! Ben , run and help Harry . One of those swabs , was he ? Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ? Step up here. ” The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid . “ Now , Morgan , ” said Long John very sternly , “ you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before ,	1880
which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones , a human skeleton lay , with a few shreds of clothing , on the ground . I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart . “ He was a seaman , ” said George Merry , who , bolder than the rest , had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing . “ Leastways , this is good sea-cloth. ” “ Aye , aye , ” said Silver ; “ like enough ; you wouldn ’ t look to find a bishop here , I reckon . But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie ? ’ Tain ’ t in	1880
, boys , ” said Mr. Dance . This time , as the distance was short , I did not mount , but ran with Dogger ’ s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens . Here Mr. Dance dismounted , and taking me along with him , was admitted at a word into the house . The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library , all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them , where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat , pipe in hand , on either side of a	1880
answer . But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd . Then he advanced to the stockade , threw over his crutch , got a leg up , and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side . I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry ; indeed , I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain , who had now seated himself on the threshold , with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the	1880
that reached us from the doctor ’ s patients . Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action , only three still breathed -- that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole , Hunter , and Captain Smollett ; and of these , the first two were as good as dead ; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor ’ s knife , and Hunter , do what we could , never recovered consciousness in this world . He lingered all day , breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit	1880
not expect to see me there , yet I took every precaution possible , and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true . He had risen from his position to his hands and knees , and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved -- for I could hear him stifle a groan -- yet it was at a good , rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck . In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked , out of a coil of rope , a long knife , or rather a short dirk , discoloured to the hilt with blood . He looked upon it for a moment , thrusting forth his under jaw ,	1880
one to that , ” cried the old mahogany-faced seaman -- Morgan by name -- whom I had seen in Long John ’ s public-house upon the quays of Bristol . “ It was him that knowed Black Dog. ” “ Well , and see here , ” added the sea-cook . “ I ’ ll put another again to that , by thunder ! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones . First and last , we ’ ve split upon Jim Hawkins ! ” “ Then here goes ! ” said Morgan with an oath . And he sprang up , drawing his knife as if	1880
; and if ever I despised a man , it was old Tom Redruth , who could do nothing but grumble and lament . Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him ; but such was not the squire ’ s pleasure , and the squire ’ s pleasure was like law among them all . Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble . The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow , and there I found my mother in good health and spirits . The captain , who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort , was gone where the wicked cease from troubling . The squire had had everything repaired , and the public rooms and the sign repainted , and had added	1880
round . I won ’ t say no . Leastways , none of us had looked out . We looked out , and by thunder , the old ship was gone ! I never seen a pack o ’ fools look fishier ; and you may lay to that , if I tells you that looked the fishiest . ‘ Well , ’ says the doctor , ‘ let ’ s bargain. ’ We bargained , him and I , and here we are : stores , brandy , block house , the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut , and in a manner of speaking , the whole blessed boat , from cross-trees to kelson . As	1880
, ” said the doctor musingly ; “ I ’ ve no right to say more ; it ’ s not my secret , you see , Silver , or , I give you my word , I ’ d tell it you . But I ’ ll go as far with you as I dare go , and a step beyond , for I ’ ll have my wig sorted by the captain or I ’ m mistaken ! And first , I ’ ll give you a bit of hope ; Silver , if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap ,	1880
was no unusual sound -- nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood . It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet , and I shall never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows ; but that , as it proved , was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter . For -- you would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselves -- no soul would consent to return with us to the Admiral Benbow . The more we told of our troubles , the more -- man , woman , and child -- they clung to the shelter of their houses . The name of Captain Flint , though it was strange to me , was	1880
of the left hand , and though he wore a cutlass , he did not look much like a fighter . I had always my eye open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and I remember this one puzzled me . He was not sailorly , and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too . I asked him what was for his service , and he said he would take rum ; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it , he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near . I paused where I was , with my napkin	1880
chatting together , with intervals of listening ; and not long after , hearing no further sound , they shouldered the tools and set forth again , Merry walking first with Silver ’ s compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island . He had said the truth : dead or alive , nobody minded Ben Gunn . Dick alone still held his Bible , and looked around him as he went , with fearful glances ; but he found no sympathy , and Silver even joked him on his precautions . “ I told you , ” said he -- “ I told you you had sp ’ iled your Bible . If it ain ’ t no good to	1880
of it on his unruly followers . They , on their part , drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house , and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously , like a stream . One after another , they would look up , and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces ; but it was not towards me , it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes . “ You seem to have a lot to say , ” remarked Silver , spitting far	1880
” said Morgan , “ that comed of sp ’ iling Bibles. ” “ That comes -- as you call it -- of being arrant asses , ” retorted the doctor , “ and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison , and the dry land from a vile , pestiferous slough . I think it most probable -- though of course it ’ s only an opinion -- that you ’ ll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems . Camp in a bog , would you ? Silver , I ’ m surprised at you . You ’ re less	1880
rate . As for the latter ’ s sailing , it was so wild and intermittent , and she hung each time so long in irons , that she certainly gained nothing , if she did not even lose . If only I dared to sit up and paddle , I made sure that I could overhaul her . The scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me , and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage . Up I got , was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray , but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself , with all my strength and caution ,	1880
above the brush , was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit , and it took me a goodish while to get up with it , crawling , often on all fours , among the scrub . Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough sides . Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf , hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep , that grew there very plentifully ; and in the centre of the dell , sure enough , a little tent of goat-skins , like what the gipsies carry about with them in England . I dropped into	1880
You ’ ll excuse me , I dare say , but you remind me of that fable . When you came in here , I ’ ll stake my wig , you meant more than this. ” “ Doctor , ” said the captain , “ you are smart . When I came in here I meant to get discharged . I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word. ” “ No more I would , ” cried the squire . “ Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce . As it is , I have heard you . I will do as you desire , but I think the worse	1880
was good , for it was only six . “ Now , Jim , ” she said , “ that key. ” I felt in his pockets , one after another . A few small coins , a thimble , and some thread and big needles , a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box were all that they contained , and I began to despair . “ Perhaps it ’ s round his neck , ” suggested my mother . Overcoming a strong repugnance , I tore open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hanging to a bit of tarry string , which I cut with his	1880
march . Oh , we see through you , John Silver ; you want to play booty , that ’ s what ’ s wrong with you . And then , fourth , there ’ s this here boy. ” “ Is that all ? ” asked Silver quietly . “ Enough , too , ” retorted George . “ We ’ ll all swing and sun-dry for your bungling. ” “ Well now , look here , I ’ ll answer these four p ’ ints ; one after another I ’ ll answer ’ em . I made a hash o ’ this cruise , did I ? Well now , you all know what I wanted , and you all know if that had been done that we ’ d ’ a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was ,	1880
Hands , already half-way towards me , with the dirk in his right hand . We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met , but while mine was the shrill cry of terror , his was a roar of fury like a charging bully ’ s . At the same instant , he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows . As I did so , I let go of the tiller , which sprang sharp to leeward , and I think this saved my life , for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him , for the moment	1880
increased the sense of solitude . Silver , as he sat , took certain bearings with his compass . “ There are three ‘ tall trees , ’ ” said he , “ about in the right line from Skeleton Island . ‘ Spy-glass shoulder , ’ I take it , means that lower p ’ int there . It ’ s child ’ s play to find the stuff now . I ’ ve half a mind to dine first. ” “ I don ’ t feel sharp , ” growled Morgan . “ Thinkin ’ o ’ Flint -- I think it were -- as done me. ” “ Ah , well , my son , you praise your stars he ’ s dead , ” said Silver . “	1880
They could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods. ” “ Look astern , doctor , ” replied the captain . We had entirely forgotten the long nine ; and there , to our horror , were the five rogues busy about her , getting off her jacket , as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed . Not only that , but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind , and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad . “ Israel was Flint ’ s gunner , ” said Gray hoarsely . At any risk , we put the boat ’ s head direct for the landing-place . By	1880
best he had to hope on our side . Nay , and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey , even then what danger lay before us ! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life -- he a cripple and I a boy -- against five strong and active seamen ! Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends , their unexplained desertion of the stockade , their inexplicable cession of the chart , or harder still to understand , the doctor ’ s last warning to Silver , “ Look out for	1880
as done me. ” “ Ah , well , my son , you praise your stars he ’ s dead , ” said Silver . “ He were an ugly devil , ” cried a third pirate with a shudder ; “ that blue in the face too ! ” “ That was how the rum took him , ” added Merry . “ Blue ! Well , I reckon he was blue . That ’ s a true word. ” Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought , they had spoken lower and lower ,	1880
; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow , the lantern-bearer following ; and then I could see them pause , and hear speeches passed in a lower key , as if they were surprised to find the door open . But the pause was brief , for the blind man again issued his commands . His voice sounded louder and higher , as if he were afire with eagerness and rage . “ In , in , in ! ” he shouted , and cursed them for their delay . Four or five of them obeyed at once , two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar . There was a pause	1880
sir , ” cried the cook , in the passage . “ Well , squire , ” said Dr. Livesey , “ I don ’ t put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suits me. ” “ The man ’ s a perfect trump , ” declared the squire . “ And now , ” added the doctor , “ Jim may come on board with us , may he not ? ” “ To be sure he may , ” says squire . “ Take your hat , Hawkins , and we ’ ll see the ship. ” IX Powder and Arms The Hispaniola lay some way	1880
before me in a whirling mist ; Silver and the birds , and the tall Spy-glass hilltop , going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes , and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear . When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together , his crutch under his arm , his hat upon his head . Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward ; but the murderer minded him not a whit , cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass . Everything else was unchanged ,	1880
heart . IV The Sea-chest I lost no time , of course , in telling my mother all that I knew , and perhaps should have told her long before , and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position . Some of the man ’ s money -- if he had any -- was certainly due to us , but it was not likely that our captain ’ s shipmates , above all the two specimens seen by me , Black Dog and the blind beggar , would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead man ’ s debts . The captain ’ s order to mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my	1880
and he ’ ll lay ’ em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint ’ s crew , man and boy , all on ’ em that ’ s left . I was first mate , I was , old Flint ’ s first mate , and I ’ m the on ’ y one as knows the place . He gave it me at Savannah , when he lay a-dying , like as if I was to now , you see . But you won ’ t peach unless they get the black spot on me , or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg , Jim -- him above all. ” “ But what is the black spot , captain ? ” I asked . “ That ’ s a summons , mate . I ’ ll tell	1880
and the anchorage , under lee of Skeleton Island , lay still and leaden as when first we entered it . The HISPANIOLA , in that unbroken mirror , was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline , the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak . Alongside lay one of the gigs , Silver in the stern-sheets -- him I could always recognize -- while a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks , one of them with a red cap -- the very rogue that I had seen some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade . Apparently they were talking and laughing , though at that distance -- upwards of a mile -- I could , of course , hear no word of what was said . All at once there began the most horrid , unearthly screaming , which at	1880
believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more , for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried , groaning and bleeding , into the log-house . Poor old fellow , he had not uttered one word of surprise , complaint , fear , or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now , when we had laid him down in the log-house to die . He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery ; he had followed every order silently , doggedly , and well ; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years ; and now , sullen , old , serviceable servant , it was he that was to	1880
river , a great fire was glowing among the trees , and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going , the men , whom I had seen so gloomy , shouting at the oars like children . But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum . At length I thought I might return towards the stockade . I was pretty far down on the low , sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east , and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island ; and now , as I rose to my feet , I saw , some	1880
bay where I had once tossed and trembled in the coracle . The first of the tall trees was reached , and by the bearings proved the wrong one . So with the second . The third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood -- a giant of a vegetable , with a red column as big as a cottage , and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred . It was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart . But it was not its size that now impressed my companions ; it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand	1880
provisions running out , knives going , and what not . Well , now I tell you , I never seen good come o ’ goodness yet . Him as strikes first is my fancy ; dead men don ’ t bite ; them ’ s my views -- amen , so be it . And now , you look here , ” he added , suddenly changing his tone , “ we ’ ve had about enough of this foolery . The tide ’ s made good enough by now . You just take my orders , Cap ’ n Hawkins , and we ’	1880
an oath that made me jump . As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner , half fawning , half sneering , patted me on the shoulder , told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me . “ I have a son of my own , ” said he , “ as like you as two blocks , and he ’ s all the pride of my ’ art . But the great thing for boys is discipline , sonny -- discipline . Now , if you had sailed along of Bill , you wouldn ’	1880
had . Ah , Jim , Jim , I reckon I ’ ve missed stays ! Cut me a quid , as ’ ll likely be the last , lad , for I ’ m for my long home , and no mistake. ” “ Well , ” said I , “ I ’ ll cut you some tobacco , but if I was you and thought myself so badly , I would go to my prayers like a Christian man. ” “ Why ? ” said he . “ Now , you tell me why. ” “ Why ? ” I	1880
archbishops I could not have been more delighted . And I was going to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure ! While I was still in this delightful dream , we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney , all dressed out like a sea-officer , in stout blue cloth , coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor ’ s walk . “ Here you are , ” he cried , “ and the doctor came last night from London . Bravo ! The ship ’ s company complete ! ” “ Oh , sir , ”	1880
had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search . On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice . One was the same as the tattoo mark , “ Billy Bones his fancy ” ; then there was “ Mr . W. Bones , mate , ” “ No more rum , ” “ Off Palm Key he got itt , ” and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible . I could not help wondering who it was that had “ got itt , ” and what “ itt ” was that he got . A knife in his back as like as not . “ Not much instruction there ,	1880
shadow moving with the tail of my eye ; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat ’ s ; but , sure enough , when I looked round , there was Hands , already half-way towards me , with the dirk in his right hand . We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met , but while mine was the shrill cry of terror , his was a roar of fury like a charging bully ’ s . At the same instant , he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows . As I did so , I let go of the tiller , which sprang sharp to leeward , and I think this saved my life , for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him , for the moment	1880
the north-east angle of the island , and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA . When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack , and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted , he had gone to Silver , given him the chart , which was now useless -- given him the stores , for Ben Gunn ’ s cave was well supplied with goats ’ meat salted by himself -- given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill , there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money . “ As for you , Jim , ” he said	1880
But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum . At length I thought I might return towards the stockade . I was pretty far down on the low , sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east , and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island ; and now , as I rose to my feet , I saw , some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes , an isolated rock , pretty high , and peculiarly white in colour . It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one . Then	1880
recovered consciousness in this world . He lingered all day , breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit , but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling , and some time in the following night , without sign or sound , he went to his Maker . As for the captain , his wounds were grievous indeed , but not dangerous . No organ was fatally injured . Anderson ’ s ball -- for it was Job that shot him first -- had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung , not	1880
the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him . First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved . But suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , “ Where ’ s Black Dog ? ” “ There is no Black Dog here , ” said the doctor , “ except what you have on your own back . You have been drinking rum ; you have had a stroke , precisely as I told you ; and I have just , very much against my own will , dragged you headforemost out of the grave . Now , Mr. Bones -- ” “ That ’ s not my name , ” he	1880
this sound of danger lent me wings . As soon as I was clear of the thicket , I ran as I never ran before , scarce minding the direction of my flight , so long as it led me from the murderers ; and as I ran , fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy . Indeed , could anyone be more entirely lost than I ? When the gun fired , how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends , still smoking from their crime ? Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe ’ s ? Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm , and therefore of my fatal knowledge ? It was all over , I thought . Good-bye to	1880
likely that our captain ’ s shipmates , above all the two specimens seen by me , Black Dog and the blind beggar , would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead man ’ s debts . The captain ’ s order to mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected , which was not to be thought of . Indeed , it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house ; the fall of coals in the kitchen grate , the very ticking of the clock , filled us with alarms . The neighbourhood , to our ears , seemed haunted by approaching footsteps ; and what between the dead body	1880
embers and shed a steady , red reverberation , contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon . There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze . I stopped , with much wonder in my heart , and perhaps a little terror also . It had not been our way to build great fires ; we were , indeed , by the captain ’ s orders , somewhat niggardly of firewood , and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent . I stole round by the eastern end , keeping close in shadow , and at a convenient place , where the darkness was thickest , crossed the palisade . To make assurance surer , I got upon my hands and knees	1880
a thumping heart . XV The Man of the Island From the side of the hill , which was here steep and stony , a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees . My eyes turned instinctively in that direction , and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine . What it was , whether bear or man or monkey , I could in no wise tell . It seemed dark and shaggy ; more I knew not . But the terror of this new apparition brought me to	1880
take that medicine ? Did he take that medicine , men ? ” “ Aye , aye , sir , he took it , sure enough , ” returned Morgan . “ Because , you see , since I am mutineers ’ doctor , or prison doctor as I prefer to call it , ” says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way , “ I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George ( God bless him ! ) and the gallows. ” The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in silence . “ Dick don ’ t feel well , sir , ” said one . “ Don ’ t he	1880
the first place , the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded . Five grown men , and three of them -- Trelawney , Redruth , and the captain -- over six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry . Add to that the powder , pork , and bread-bags . The gunwale was lipping astern . Several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards . The captain made us trim	1880
as calm as though he had been in church ; yet his eye kept wandering furtively , and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers . They , on their part , drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house , and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously , like a stream . One after another , they would look up , and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces ; but it was not towards me , it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes . “ You seem to	1880
as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner . My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass , and I watched the cook narrowly . But he was too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver . “ See here , now , Hawkins , ” said he , “ here ’ s a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ain ’ t it ? There ’	1880
Understand me , Jim , ” he said , returning . “ I ’ ve a head on my shoulders , I have . I ’ m on squire ’ s side now . I know you ’ ve got that ship safe somewheres . How you done it , I don ’ t know , but safe it is . I guess Hands and O ’ Brien turned soft . I never much believed in neither of THEM . Now you mark me . I ask no questions , nor I won ’ t let others . I know when a game ’ s up , I do ; and I know a lad that ’ s staunch . Ah , you that ’ s young -- you and me might have done a power of good together ! ” He drew some cognac	1880
bad one in itself . I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea , find the white rock I had observed last evening , and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat , a thing quite worth doing , as I still believe . But as I was certain I should not be allowed to leave the enclosure , my only plan was to take French leave and slip out when nobody was watching , and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong . But I was only a boy , and I had made my mind up . Well , as things at last fell out , I found an admirable opportunity . The squire and Gray were busy	1880
of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right . If some go , you mark my words , sir , Silver ’ ll bring ’ em aboard again as mild as lambs. ” It was so decided ; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men ; Hunter , Joyce , and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for , and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew . “ My lads , ” said he , “ we ’ ve had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts . A turn ashore ’ ll hurt nobody -- the	1880
smile that appeared continually on his face . It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness -- a haggard old man ’ s smile ; but there was , besides that , a grain of derision , a shadow of treachery , in his expression as he craftily watched , and watched , and watched me at my work . XXVI Israel Hands The wind , serving us to a desire , now hauled into the west . We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet . Only , as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther , time hung on our hands . The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to ; after a	1880
where I might batten them down , perhaps , and do what I chose with the ship . For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for me -- standing still . She headed nearly due south , yawing , of course , all the time . Each time she fell off , her sails partly filled , and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again . I have said this was the worst thing possible for me , for helpless as she looked in this situation , with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck , she still continued to run away from me , not only with the speed of the current , but by the whole amount of her leeway , which was naturally great . But now	1880
. Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house , to be out of earshot of our officers consulting ; and Gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again , so thunder-struck he was at this occurrence . “ Why , in the name of Davy Jones , ” said he , “ is Dr. Livesey mad ? ” “ Why no , ” says I . “ He ’ s about the last of this crew for that , I take it. ” “ Well , shipmate , ” said Gray , “ mad he may not be ; but if HE ’ S	1880
, who , by the way , is to send a consort after us if we don ’ t turn up by the end of August , had found an admirable fellow for sailing master -- a stiff man , which I regret , but in all other respects a treasure . Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate , a man named Arrow . I have a boatswain who pipes , Livesey ; so things shall go man-o ’ -war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA . I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance ; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker ’ s account , which has never been overdrawn . He leaves his wife to manage the inn ; and as she is a woman	1880
’ s as may be , ” replied the captain . “ Oh , well , you have , I know that , ” returned Long John . “ You needn ’ t be so husky with a man ; there ain ’ t a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it . What I mean is , we want your chart . Now , I never meant you no harm , myself. ” “ That won ’ t do with me , my man , ” interrupted the captain . “ We know exactly what you meant to do , and we don ’ t care , for now , you see , you can ’ t do it. ” And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe . “ If Abe	1880
, ” she said , “ that key. ” I felt in his pockets , one after another . A few small coins , a thimble , and some thread and big needles , a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box were all that they contained , and I began to despair . “ Perhaps it ’ s round his neck , ” suggested my mother . Overcoming a strong repugnance , I tore open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hanging to a bit of tarry string ,	1880
chains a-jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy . Now , that ’ s about where we are , every mother ’ s son of us , thanks to him , and Hands , and Anderson , and other ruination fools of you . And if you want to know about number four , and that boy , why , shiver my timbers , isn ’ t he a hostage ? Are we a-going to waste a hostage ?

As inventor of the personage Childe Harold , the hero and so-called 'Pilgrim ' of the poem _Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage_ , and as being himself to a great extent identical with his hero , Byron was frequently termed 'the Pilgrim . ' Shelley adopts this designation , which he magnifies into 'the Pilgrim of Eternity , ' He admired Byron most enthusiastically as a poet , and was generally on easy -- sometimes on cordial -- terms with him as a man . He has left us a fine and discriminating portrait of Byron in the 'Count Maddalo ' of his poem _Julian and Maddalo_ , written in . At times however Shelley felt and expressed great indignation against Byron , especially in reference to the ungenerous and	1820

I do not know even whether it has been published , and still less whether it has been republished with the alterations I sent .

( To Gisborne , 10 April ) ' I know what to think of _Adonais_ , but what to think of those who confound it with the many bad poems of the day I know not .

PREFACE . Line 1 . _Adonais_ . There is nothing to show positively why Shelley adopted the name Adonais as a suitable Hellenic name for John Keats . I have already suggested ( p. 59 ) that he may perhaps have wished to indicate , in this indirect	1820
academic censure , and they got it in its extremest form . Shelley wrote , probably with some co-operation from Hogg , and he published anonymously in Oxford , a little pamphlet called _The Necessity of Atheism_ ; he projected sending it round broadcast as an invitation or challenge to discussion . This small pamphlet -- it is scarcely more than a flysheet -- hardly amounts to saying that Atheism is irrefragably true , and Theism therefore false ; but it propounds that the existence of a God can not be proved by reason , nor yet by testimony ; that a direct revelation made to an individual would alone be adequate ground for convincing	1820

And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head , And fans him with her moonlight wings , and cries , 'Our love , our hope , our sorrow , is not dead ! See , on the silken fringe of his faint eyes , Like dew upon a sleeping flower , there lies 5 A tear some Dream has loosened from	1820
gone where all things wise and fair Descend._ Founded on Bion ( p. 64 ) , 'Persephone , ... all lovely things drift down to thee . ' 1 . 7 , _The amorous deep._ The depth of earth , or region of the dead ; amorous , because , having once obtained possession of Adonais , it retains him in a close embrace , and will not restore him to the land of the living . This passage has a certain analogy to that of Bion ( p. 65 ) , 'Not that he is loth to hear , but that the maiden of Hades will not let him go . ' +Stanza 4 , + 1 . 1 . _Most musical of mourners._ This phrase , applying to Urania , is one	1820
expression in st. 38 -- 'The pure spirit shall flow Back to the burning fountain whence it came , A portion of the Eternal . ' 1 . 8 . _Who wields the world with never wearied love_ , & c. These two lines are about the nearest approach to definite Theism to be found in any writing of Shelley . The conception , which may amount to Theism , is equally consistent with Pantheism . Even in his most anti-theistic poem , _Queen Mab_ , Shelley said in a note -- 'The hypothesis of a pervading Spirit , co-eternal with the universe	1820
that Shelley means 'unseen ' ; not so much that the lightning is itself unseen as that its action in fusing the sword , which remains concealed within the sheath , is unseen . But the more obvious sense of 'blind , unregardful , ' could also be justified . 11 . 8 , 9 . _Th ' intense atom glows A moment , then is quenched in a most cold repose._ The term 'th ' intense atom ' is a synonym for 'that which knows , ' or the mind . By death it is 'quenched in a most cold repose ' : but the repose is not necessarily extinction . +Stanza 21 , + 11 . 1 , 2 . _Alas that all we loved of him should be , But for our grief , as if it had not been._ 'All we loved of	1820

But for Heaven 's sake , young Sangrado , be a little more sparing of extenuatives and soporifics in your practice than you have been in your poetry .

( ) 'Keats had been dished -- utterly demolished and dished -- by _Blackwood_ long before Mr. Gifford	1820
one of the lowest forms of life , is constantly used as a term implying contempt ; but it may be assumed that Shelley here uses 'worm ' in its original sense , that of any crawling creature , more especially of the snake kind . There would thus be no departure from the previous epithet 'viperous . ' See the remarks as to 'reptiles , ' St. 29 . 11 . 5 , 6 . _The magic tone Whose prelude , _ & c. Shelley , it will be perceived , here figures Keats as a minstrel striking the lyre , and preparing to sing . He strikes the lyre in a	1820
. In these statements I see nothing either unveracious or unlikely : but it is true that a sceptical habit of mind , which insists upon express evidence and upon severe sifting of evidence , may remain unconvinced [ 2 ] . This was the second suicide in Shelley 's immediate circle , for Fanny Wollstonecraft had taken poison just before under rather unaccountable circumstances . No doubt he felt dismay and horror , and self-reproach as well ; yet there is nothing to show that he condemned his conduct , at any stage of the transactions with Harriet , as heinously wrong . He took the earliest opportunity -- 30th of December -- of marrying Mary Godwin ; and thus he became reconciled to her father and	1820
civil to Shelley , though of course with some serious offsets . The notices of _Alastor , Rosalind and Helen_ , and _Prometheus Unbound_ -- more especially the first -- in the years and , would be found to bear out this statement . From the dates already cited , it may be assumed that the Pisan edition of _Adonais_ was in London in the hands of Mr. Ollier towards the middle of August , , purchasable by whoever might be minded to buy it . Very soon afterwards it was reprinted in the _Literary Chronicle and Weekly Review_ , published by Limbird in the Strand -- 1 December , : a rather singular , not to say piratical , proceeding	1820
, which , if he had money by him , he would buy , that it might be published . Finch is a great admirer of architecture in Italy . Mr. Werthern , a gentleman most peaceable and quiet I ever saw , accompanying Finch , whose only occupation [ I understand this to mean the occupation of Wethern , but possibly it means of Finch ] is , when he arrives at a town or other place , to set about sketching , and then colouring , so that he has perhaps the most complete collection of sketches of his tour possible . He invited me ( taking me for an Italian ) , in case I went to England , to see him ; and , hearing I was English , he pressed me much more	1820
relation of Shelley 's Elegy of _Adonais_ to the two Elegies written by Bion and by Moschus must no doubt have been observed , and been more or less remarked upon , as soon as _Adonais_ obtained some currency among classical readers ; Captain Medwin , in his _Shelley Papers_ , , referred to it . I am not however aware that the resemblances had ever been brought out in detail until Mr. G.S.D . Murray , of Christ Church , Oxford , noted down the passages from Bion , which were published accordingly in my edition of Shelley 's Poems , . Since then , , Lieut.-Colonel Hime , R.A. , issued a pamphlet ( Dulau & Co. ) entitled _The Greek Materials of Shelley 's Adonais , with Remarks	1820
be thou free To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow._ This keeps up the image of the 'viperous ' murderer -- the viper . 'At thy season ' can be understood as a reference to the periodical issues of the _Quarterly Review_ . The word ' o'erflow ' is , in the Pisan edition , printed as two words -- ' o'er flow . ' 1 . 7 . _Remorse and self-contempt._ Shelley frequently dwells upon self-contempt as one of the least tolerable of human distresses . Thus in the _Revolt of Islam_ ( Canto 8 , st. 20 ) : 'Yes , it is Hate -- that shapeless fiendly thing Of many names , all evil , some divine -- Whom self-contempt arms with a mortal sting , ' & c. And in _Prometheus Unbound_	1820
would impart brilliancy to the sphere itself . 1 . 8 . _Silent alone amid an heaven of song._ This phrase points primarily to 'the music of the spheres ' : the sphere now assigned to Keats had hitherto failed to take part in the music of its fellows , but henceforward will chime in . Probably there is also a subsidiary , but in its context not less prominent meaning -- namely , that , while the several poets ( such as Chatterton , Sidney , and Lucan ) had each a vocal sphere of his own , apposite to his particular poetic quality ,	1820
pale flower by some sad maiden cherished , And fed with true love tears instead of dew._ It seems sufficiently clear that Shelley is here glancing at a leading incident in Keats 's poem of _Isabella , or the Pot of Basil_ , founded upon a story in Boccaccio 's _Decameron_ . Isabella unburies her murdered lover Lorenzo ; preserves his head in a pot of basil ; and ( as expressed in st. 52 of the poem ) 'Hung over her sweet basil evermore , And moistened it with tears unto the core . ' I give Shelley 's words 'true love tears ' as they appear in the Pisan edition : 'true-love tears ' might be preferable . 1 . 9	1820
saying -- 'Take your last look of the dead Adonais while he may still seem to the eye to be rather sleeping than dead . ' 1 . 7 . _He lies as if in dewy sleep he lay._ See Bion ( p. 64 ) , 'Beautiful in death , as one that hath fallen on sleep . ' The term 'dewy sleep ' means probably 'sleep which refreshes the body as nightly dew refreshes the fields . ' This phrase is followed by the kindred expression 'liquid rest . ' +Stanza 8 , + 1 . 3 . _The shadow of white Death_ , & c. The use of 'his ' and 'her ' in this stanza is not wholly free from ambiguity . In st. 7 Death was a male impersonation -- 'kingly Death ' who 'keeps his pale court . '	1820

The spirit which once was the vital or mental essence -- the soul -- of Adonais came from the Eternal Soul , and , now that he is dead , is re-absorbed into the Eternal Soul : as such , it is imperishable . 1 . 9 . _Whilst thy cold embers choke_ , & c. The spirit of Adonais came as a flame from the 'burning fountain ' of the Eternal , and has now reverted thither , he being one of the 'enduring dead . ' But the 'deaf and viperous murderer ' must not hope for	1820

Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous earth ; As from a centre , dart thy spirit 's light Beyond all worlds , until its spacious might 5 Satiate the void circumference : then shrink Even to a point within our day and night ; And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink When hope has kindled hope , and lured thee to the brink . 48 .

They are herded wolves , which will venture to pursue a traveller , but will not face him if he turns upon them boldly ; and obscene ravens , which make an uproar over dead bodies , or dead reputations ; and vultures , which follow in the wake of a conqueror , and gorge upon that which is already overthrown . In the succeeding stanza , 29	1820
thou hyacinth , whisper the letters on thee graven , and add a deeper ai ai to thy petals : he is dead , the beautiful singer .... Nor so much did pleasant Lesbos mourn for Alcaeus , ' & c. The passage of Shelley is rather complicated in its significance , because it mixes up the personages Hyacinthus and Narcissus with the flowers hyacinth and narcissus . The beautiful youth Hyacinthus was dear to Phoebus ; on his untimely death ( he was slain by a quoit which Phoebus threw , and which the jealous Zephyrus blew aside so that it struck Hyacinthus on the head ) , the	1820
did assent , professing conscientious objections ) to another estate still larger . Shelley was not in love with Harriet ; but he liked her , and was willing to do anything he could to further her wishes and plans . Mr. Timothy Shelley , after a while , pardoned his son 's misadventure at Oxford , and made him a moderate allowance of £200 a-year . Percy then visited a cousin in Wales , a member of the Grove family . He was recalled to London by Harriet Westbrook , who protested against a project of sending her back to school . He counselled resistance . She replied in July ( to quote a contemporary letter from Shelley to Hogg ) , 'that resistance	1820
clause by itself , meaning , 'As _if_ in the accents of an unknown land , he sang new sorrow . ' 11 . 8 , 9 . _Made bare his branded and ensanguined brow , Which was like Cain 's or Christ's._ Shelley represents his own brow as being branded like Cain 's -- stamped with the mark of reprobation ; and ensanguined like Christ 's -- bleeding from a crown of thorns . This indicates the extreme repugnance with which he was generally regarded , and in especial perhaps the decree of the Court of Chancery which deprived him of his children by his first marriage -- and generally	1820
. 9 . _And lured thee to the brink._ This phrase is not definitely accounted for in the preceding exposition . I think Shelley means that the successive hopes kindled in the mourner by the ideas of a boundless universe of space and of spirit will have lured him to the very brink of mundane life -- to the borderland between life and death : he will almost have been tempted to have done with life , and to explore the possibilities of death . +Stanza 48 , + 1 . 1 . _Or go to Rome._ This is still addressed to the mourner , the 'fond wretch ' of the preceding stanza . He is here invited to adopt a	1820

' I have little hope therefore that the poem I send you will excite any attention , nor do I feel assured that a critical notice of his writings would find a single reader . But for these considerations , it had been my intention to have collected the remnants of his compositions , and to have published them with a Life and criticism . Has he left any poems or writings of whatsoever kind , and in whose possession are they ? Perhaps you would oblige me by information on this point .

The _Quarterly_ _Review_ for July contains a critique of Milman 's poem , _Samor , Lord of the Bright City_ ; and the number for May , a critique of Milman 's _Fall of Jerusalem_ . Neither of these notices draws any parallel such as Shelley speaks of . 1 . 52 . _What gnat did they strain at here_ . The word 'here ' will be perceived to mean 'in _Endymion_ , ' or 'in reference to _Endymion_	1820

most unreasonable presumption .... Such assertions ... persuade indeed only those who desire to be persuaded .

Note to the chorus , 'Worlds on worlds are rolling ever , ' & c. ) 'The first stanza contrasts the immortality of the living and thinking beings which inhabit the planets and ( to use a common and inadequate phrase ) clothe themselves in matter , with the transcience of the noblest manifestations of the external world .

If the mind were to die , while the body continues extant ( not indeed in the form of a human body , but in various phases of ulterior development ) , then the	1820
A letter from Keats has been published showing that at one time he expected to meet Moore personally ( see p. 45 ) . Whether he did so or not I can not say for certain , but I apprehend not : the published Diary of Moore , of about the same date , suggests the negative . +Stanza 31 , + 1 . 1 . _'Midst others of less note._ Shelley clearly means 'less note ' than Byron and Moore -- not less note than the 'one frail form .

At the house of the Dilkes , in the autumn of , Keats made the acquaintance of Miss Fanny Brawne , the orphan daughter of a gentleman of independent means : he was soon desperately in love with her , having ' a swooning admiration of her beauty : ' towards the spring of they engaged to marry , with the prospect of a long engagement . On the night of 3 February , , on returning to the house at Hampstead which he shared with Mr. Brown , the poet had his first attack , a violent one , of blood-spitting from the lungs . He rallied somewhat , but suffered	1820

The curse of birth can eclipse the benediction of Universal Mind , but can not quench it : in other words , the human mind , in its passage from the birth to the death of the body , is still an integral portion of the Universal Mind . 1 . 7 . _Each are mirrors._ This is of course	1820
middle of November went on to Rome . Here Keats received the most constant and kind attention from Dr. ( afterwards Sir James ) Clark . But all was of no avail : after continual and severe suffering , devotedly watched by Severn , he expired on 23 February , . He was buried in the old Protestant Cemetery of Rome , under a little altar-tomb sculptured with a Greek lyre . His name was inscribed , along with the epitaph which he himself had composed in the bitterness of his soul , 'Here lies one whose name was writ in water . ' Keats was an undersized man , little more than five feet high . His face was handsome , ardent , and full of expression ; the hair rich , brown , and curling ;	1820

He treats the unillumined part as if it were the whole earth -- which has hereby become ' a corpse . ' +Stanza 24 , + 1 . 2 , _Through camps and cities_ , & c. In highly figurative language , this stanza pictures the passage of Urania from 'her secret paradise ' to the death-chamber of Adonais in Rome , as if the spiritual essence and external form of the goddess were wounded by the uncongenial atmosphere of human malice and detraction through which she has to pass . The whole description is spiritualized from that of Bion ( p. 63 ) : -- 'Wildered , ungirt , unsandalled -- the thorns pierce Her hastening feet , and drink	1820

See p. 33 . +Stanza 9 , + 1. i . _The quick Dreams._ With these words begins a passage of some length , which is closely modelled upon the passage of Bion ( p. 64 ) , 'And around him the Loves are weeping , ' & c. : modelled upon it , and also systematically transposed from it . The transposition goes on the same lines as that of Adonis into Adonais , and of the Cyprian into the Uranian Aphrodite ; i.e . the personal or fleshly Loves are spiritualized into Dreams ( musings , reveries , conceptions ) and other faculties or emotions of the mind . It is to be observed , moreover , that the trance of Adonis attended	1820

He was recalled to London by Harriet Westbrook , who protested against a project of sending her back to school . He counselled resistance . She replied in July ( to quote a contemporary letter from Shelley to Hogg ) , 'that resistance was useless , but that she would fly with me , and threw herself upon my protection .

therefore false ; but it propounds that the existence of a God can not be proved by reason , nor yet by testimony ; that a direct revelation made to an individual would alone be adequate ground for convincing that individual ; and that the persons to whom such a revelation is not accorded are in consequence warranted in remaining unconvinced . The College authorities got wind of the pamphlet , and found reason for regarding Shelley as its author , and on March 25 , , they summoned him to appear . He was required to say whether he had written it or not . To this demand he refused an answer , and was then expelled by a written sentence , ready drawn up . With Hogg the like process was repeated . Their offence , as entered on the College records , was that of 'contumaciously refusing	1820

this literary ally . Possibly the taunts of the _Quarterly Review_ , and the alienation of Keats from Hunt , had some connexion as cause and effect . In a letter from John Keats to his brother George and his sister-in-law occurs the following passage [ 16 ] , dated towards the end of : 'Hunt has asked me to meet Tom Moore some day -- so you shall hear of him .

A grave among the eternal._ Keats , dying in Rome , secured sepulture among the many illustrious persons who are there buried . This seems to be the only meaning of 'the eternal ' in the present passage : the term does not directly imply ( what is sufficiently enforced elsewhere ) Keats 's own poetic immortality . 1 . 4 . _Come away ! _ This call is addressed in fancy to any persons present in the chamber of death . They remain indefinite both to the poet and to the reader . The conclusion of the stanza , worded with great beauty and delicacy , amounts substantially to saying -- 'Take your last look of the dead Adonais while he may still seem to the eye to be rather sleeping than dead .

John Clarke , at Enfield : the son Charles Cowden Clarke , whom I have previously mentioned , was an undermaster , and paid particular attention to Keats . The latter did not show any remarkable talent at school , but learned easily , and was ' a very orderly scholar , ' acquiring a fair amount of Latin but no Greek . He was active , pugnacious , and popular among his school-fellows . The father died of a fall from his horse in April , : the mother , after re-marrying , succumbed to consumption in February , .

It is possible however -- and one willingly supposes so -- that Shelley singled out the nightingale for mention , in recognition of the consummate beauty of Keats 's _Ode to the Nightingale_ , published in the same volume with _Hyperion_ . The epithet 'lorn ' may also be noted in the same connexion ; as Keats 's Ode terminates with a celebrated passage in which 'forlorn ' is the leading word ( but not as an epithet for the nightingale itself ) -- 'Forlorn ! -- the very word is as a knell , ' & c. The nightingale is also introduced into the Elegy of Moschus for Bion ; 'Ye nightingales that lament , ' & c. ( p. 65 ) , and 'Nor ever sang	1820
. '' Pursuing the same thread of reasoning , the existence of distinct individual minds , similar to that which is employed in now questioning its own nature , is likewise found to be a delusion . The words `` I , you , they , '' are not signs of any actual difference subsisting between the assemblage of thoughts thus indicated , but are merely marks employed to denote the different modifications of the one mind . Let it not be supposed that this doctrine conducts to the monstrous presumption that I , the person who now write and think , am that one mind . I am but a portion of it .

the statement in stanza 45 that 'the inheritors of unfulfilled renown rose from their thrones ' ( which can not be taken to represent distinct spheres or constellations ) suggests the opposite interpretation . Keats is termed 'thou Vesper of our throng ' because he is the latest member of this glorified band -- or , reckoning the lapse of ages as if they were but a day , its 'evening star . ' The exceptional brilliancy of the Vesper star is not , I think , implied -- though it may be remotely suggested . +Stanza 47 , + 1 . 3 . _Clasp with thy panting soul_ , & c.

He therefore seems to present the act of Spring from two separate points of view : ( 1 ) She threw down the buds , as if she had been Autumn , whose office it is to	1820

' ( This last point is rather the reverse of a phrase in Bion 's Elegy , p. 64 , 'The flowers flush red for anguish . ' ) It may perhaps be held that the transition from the youths to the flowers , and from the emotions of Phoebus and of Narcissus to those assigned to the flowers , is not very happily managed by Shelley : it is artificial , and not free from confusion .

At first he supposed the writer to be Southey ; afterwards , the Rev . Mr. ( Dean ) Milman . His indignant phrase is therefore levelled at Milman .

he perished . ' The criticism which Shelley intended to write on _Hyperion_ remained , to all appearance , unwritten . It will be seen , from the letter of Shelley to Mr. Severn cited further on ( p. 34 ) , that , from the notion of writing a criticism on _Hyperion_ to precede _Adonais_ , his intention developed into the project of writing a criticism and biography of Keats in general , to precede a volume of his entire works ; but that , before the close of November , the whole scheme was given up , on the ground that it would produce no impression	1820

Keats had advanced no dogmas which he was bound to support by examples . His nonsense , therefore , is quite gratuitous ; he writes it for its own sake , and , being bitten by Mr. Leigh Hunt 's insane criticism , more than rivals the insanity of his poetry . 'Mr . Keats 's preface hints that his poem was produced under peculiar circumstances . `` Knowing within myself . '' he says , `` the manner in which this poem has been produced , it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it public . What manner I mean will be quite clear to the reader , who must soon perceive great inexperience , immaturity , and every error denoting a feverish attempt rather than a deed accomplished . '' We humbly	1820
it might seem that the 'circumstance ' which prevented Keats from staying with Shelley in Pisa was that his nerves were in so irritable a state as to prompt him to move from place to place in Italy rather than fix in any particular city or house . [ 5 ] Though Shelley gave this advice , which was anything but unsound , he is said to have taken good-naturedly some steps with a view to getting the volume printed . Mr. John Dix , writing in , says : 'He [ Shelley ] went to Charles Richards , the printer in St. Martin 's Lane , when quite young , about the printing a little volume of Keats 's first poems .	1820
under circumstances that made the feeling extremely bitter , an irritable morbidity appears even to have driven his suspicions to excess ; and this not only with regard to the acquaintance whom he might reasonably suppose to have had some advantages over him , but to myself , who had none ; for I learned the other day with extreme pain ... that Keats , at one period of his intercourse with us , suspected both Shelley and myself of a wish to see him undervalued ! Such are the tricks which constant infelicity can play with the most noble natures . For Shelley let _Adonais_ answer .

equal , to some of his other compositions . To take , for instance , two poems not very different in length from _Adonais_ -- _The Witch of Atlas_ is more original , and _Epipsychidion_ more abstract in ideal . I have endeavoured to present in my introductory matter a comprehensive account of all particulars relevant to _Adonais_ itself , and to Keats as its subject , and Shelley as its author . The accounts here given of both these great poets are of course meagre , but I assume them to be not insufficient for our immediate and restricted purpose . There are many other books which the reader can profitably consult as to the life and works of Shelley ; and three or four ( at least ) as to the	1820
which that poetic figure is associated . The numerals which I put in parentheses indicate the stanzas in which the details occur . ( 1 ) Adonais is now dead : the Hour which witnessed his loss mourns him , and is to rouse the other Hours to mourn . ( 2 ) He was the son of the widowed Urania , ( 6 ) her youngest and dearest son . ( 2 ) He was slain by a nightly arrow -- 'pierced by the shaft which flies in darkness .

spiritual or immaterial quality of the Dreams ) : the fire is to be quenched against the frost of the death-cold cheek of Adonais . 'Frozen tears -- frozen cheek : ' Shelley would scarcely , I apprehend , have allowed this repetition , but for some inadvertence . I am free to acknowledge that I think the whole of this stanza bad . Its _raison d'être_ is a figurative but perfectly appropriate and straightforward passage in Bion : Shelley has attempted to turn that into a still more figurative passage suitable for _Adonais_ , with a result anything but happy . He fails to make it either straightforward or appropriate , and declines into the super-subtle or wiredrawn . +Stanza 12 , + 1 . 1 . _Another Splendour._ Another	1820

it up -- but not always to my own satisfaction . I have seldom had to discuss the opinions of previous writers on the same points , for the simple reason that of detailed criticism of _Adonais_ , apart from merely textual memoranda , there is next to none . It has appeared to me to be part of my duty to point out here and there , but by no means frequently , some special beauty in the poem ; occasionally also something which seems to me defective or faulty . I am aware that this latter is an invidious office , which naturally exposes one to an imputation , from some quarters , of obtuseness , and , from others , of presumption ; none the less I have expressed myself with the frankness which , according to	1820
is here represented ) was Adonais slain by an insidiously or murderously launched dart : see p. 49 . The allusion is to the truculent attack made upon Keats by the _Quarterly Review_ . It is true that 'the shaft which flies in darkness ' might be understood in merely a general sense , as the mysterious and unforeseen arrow of Death : but I think it clear that Shelley used the phrase in a more special sense . 1 . 4 . _With veiled eyes_ , & c. Urania is represented as seated in her paradise ( pleasure-ground , garden-bower ) , with veiled eyes -- downward-lidded , as in slumber : an Echo chaunts or recites the 'melodies , ' or poems , which Adonais had composed while Death was rapidly advancing towards	1820
the punctuation of the Pisan edition -- with a comma after 'words , ' as well as after 'sky , flowers , ' & c. According to this punctuation , the words of Rome , as well as her sky and other beautiful endowments , are too weak to declare at full the glory which they impart ; and the inference from this rather abruptly introduced recurrence to Rome is ( I suppose ) , that the spiritual glory faintly adumbrated by Rome can only be realised in that realm of eternity to which death gives access . Taken in this sense , the 'words ' of Rome appear to mean 'the beautiful language spoken in Rome ' -- the Roman or Latin language , as modified into modern Italian . The pronunciation of Italian in Rome is counted peculiarly	1820

It is a poem of convenient length for such a purpose , being neither short nor decidedly long ; and -- leaving out of count some of the short poems -- is the one by this author which approaches nearest to being 'popular . ' It is elevated in sentiment , classical in form , -- in substance , biographical in relation to Keats , and in some minor degree autobiographical for Shelley himself . On these grounds it claimed a reasonable preference over all his other poems , for the present method of treatment ; although some students of Shelley , myself included , might be disposed to maintain that , in point of absolute intrinsic beauty and achievement , and of the qualities most especially characteristic of its author , it is not superior , or indeed	1820

in its way ; but it did not alarm us half so seriously as the calm , settled , imperturbable , drivelling idiocy of _Endymion_ .... We hope however that , in so young a person and with a constitution originally so good , even now the disease is not utterly incurable .... Mr. Hunt is a small poet , but a clever man ; Mr. Keats is a still smaller poet , and he is only a boy of pretty abilities which he has done everything in his power to spoil .... It is a better and wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet : so back to the shop	1820
understand why Shelley should have supposed this criticism to be laudatory : it is in fact unmixed censure . As thus : -- 'He appears to us to have no one quality which we should require in a tragic poet .... We can not find in the whole play a single character finely conceived or rightly sustained , a single incident well managed , a single speech -- nay a single sentence -- of good poetry . ' It is true that the same article which reviews Payne 's _Brutus_ notices also , and with more indulgence , Sheil 's _Evadne_ : possibly Shelley glanced at the article very cursorily , and fancied	1820
it . I am not however aware that the resemblances had ever been brought out in detail until Mr. G.S.D . Murray , of Christ Church , Oxford , noted down the passages from Bion , which were published accordingly in my edition of Shelley 's Poems , . Since then , , Lieut.-Colonel Hime , R.A. , issued a pamphlet ( Dulau & Co. ) entitled _The Greek Materials of Shelley 's Adonais , with Remarks on the three Great English Elegies_ , entering into further , yet not exhaustive , particulars on the same subject . Shelley himself made a fragmentary translation from the Elegy of Bion on Adonis : it was first printed in Mr. Forman 's edition of Shelley 's Poems , . I append here	1820
comfort and attention . ' Shelley did not , however , re-invite Keats to his own house on the present occasion ; writing to Miss Clairmont , 'We are not rich enough for that sort of thing . ' The letter to Miss Clairmont is dated 18 February , , and appears to have been almost simultaneous with the one sent to Keats . In that case , Keats can not be supposed to have received the invitation ; for he had towards the middle of November quitted Naples for Rome , and by 18 February he was almost at his last gasp .

The passage of Shelley is rather complicated in its significance , because it mixes up the personages Hyacinthus and Narcissus with the flowers hyacinth and narcissus .
