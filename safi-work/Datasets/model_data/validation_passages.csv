"hich I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters.” “Well said,” growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute on Mowgli’s shoulder. “A brave heart and a courteous tongue,” said he. “They shall carry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it is not well that thou shouldst see.” The moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys huddled together on the walls and battlements looked l",1890,The Jungle Book,1890_The_Jungle_Book_passage_6,19,1890_The_Jungle_Book
" that more and more seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at once, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to turn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through, getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the holluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes.

"Wolf softly. The baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide. “Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man’s cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man’s cub among her children?” “I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in my time,” said Father Wolf. “He is altogether without hair, and I could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not afraid.” The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan’s great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance.

"g Toomai said, “We have swept the hills of wild elephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in driving. Must I keep order along the whole line?” “Hear him!” said the other driver. “We have swept the hills! Ho! Ho! You are very wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who never saw the jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the season. Therefore all the wild elephants to-night will--but why should I waste wisdom on a river-turtle?” “What will they do?” Little Toomai called out. “Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast a ",1890,The Jungle Book,1890_The_Jungle_Book_passage_9,19,1890_The_Jungle_Book
"I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey People! Faugh!” A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look up, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross each other’s path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then they would howl and shriek s",1890,The Jungle Book,1890_The_Jungle_Book_passage_10,19,1890_The_Jungle_Book

Let us go, Akela.” A woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: “Oh, my son, my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast at will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo says thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo’s death.” “Come back, Messua!” shouted the crowd. “Come back, or we will stone thee.” Mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in the mouth. “Run back, Messua.

The branches are not what they were when I was young. Rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all.” “Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,” said Baloo. “I am a fair length--a fair length,” said Kaa with a little pride. “But for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. I came very near to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my slipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tre",1890,The Jungle Book,1890_The_Jungle_Book_passage_12,19,1890_The_Jungle_Book

I walked out of my lines to get a little peace and quiet here.” “My lords,” said the camel humbly, “we dreamed bad dreams in the night, and we were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.” “Then why didn’t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native Infantry, instead of running all round the camp?” said the mule. “They were such very bad dreams,” said the camel. “I am sorry.

Those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard.” “I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told.” “But it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was,” said Baloo. “The best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and be",1890,The Jungle Book,1890_The_Jungle_Book_passage_14,19,1890_The_Jungle_Book
